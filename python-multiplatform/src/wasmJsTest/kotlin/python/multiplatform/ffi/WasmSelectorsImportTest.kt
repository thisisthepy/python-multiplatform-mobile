/**
 * `import selectors` used to take the whole Node process down on this target, and `import asyncio`
 * with it. docs/upcall-async-design.md 9.5 recorded that as `RuntimeError: unreachable` and left
 * the cause open; 15 has it now, and it was never about `selectors` or about wasm.
 *
 * Emscripten feature-detects JSPI at runtime and wraps only `main` in `WebAssembly.promising`.
 * This library never calls `main`, so on a JSPI-capable Node the blocking syscalls became
 * suspending imports with no promising frame on the stack. `selectors.py` calls
 * `select.poll().poll(0)` at import time to pick its DefaultSelector, so it was the first module
 * to hit one. `cpython.mjs` now deletes `WebAssembly.promising`/`Suspending` before booting
 * Emscripten, which puts the blocking syscalls back on their synchronous path.
 *
 * These assertions are cheap, but each one is a statement that the process is still alive: the
 * old failure was not an exception a test could catch, it was `abort()`. A regression here does
 * not show up as red -- it shows up as the whole wasm suite reporting as lost, which is exactly
 * what happened when this case first went into `commonTest`. It stays in `wasmJsTest` because
 * this is the only target where the JSPI boot decision exists at all.
