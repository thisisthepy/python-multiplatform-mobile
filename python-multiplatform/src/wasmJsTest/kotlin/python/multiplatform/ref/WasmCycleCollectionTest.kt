 * ROADMAP §7 and §10: CPython calling Kotlin, and a cross-language cycle actually being collected.
 *
 * `ProxyTypeFactory` threw on this target until the registration step existed, so this is the test
 * that says whether upcalls work here at all -- every assertion below runs Kotlin code that CPython
 * itself invoked, through `call_indirect` into a `@WasmExport`.
 *
 * The two cases are deliberately the same pair `desktopTest/CycleCollectionTest` uses, because they
 * exercise two different slots that fail in different ways: `tp_clear` on the cyclic route and
 * `tp_dealloc` on the ordinary one. A proxy that dies without a cycle -- which is almost all of
 * them -- never goes near `tp_clear`.
