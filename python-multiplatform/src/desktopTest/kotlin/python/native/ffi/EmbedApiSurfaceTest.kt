/**
 * Issue #4 -- "reclassify the Python/C API `expect` declarations, add the `actual` definitions" --
 * re-derived from the sources on every run instead of counted by hand once.
 *
 * ## Why this is a test and not a paragraph in a document
 *
 * `docs/ecosystem.md` §5c recorded "335 `expect` against 315 desktop `actual`, 20 unaccounted for"
 * and left it open. That number came from `grep -c`, and `grep` cannot see comments. Kotlin block
 * comments **nest**, so `EmbedAPI.kt` opened one doc-comment at line 28 that ran to line 249 and
 * swallowed a superseded first draft of Sections 1 and 2 -- twenty `expect` declarations that no
 * compiler ever saw, and exactly the twenty §5c could not account for. `EmbedAPI.native.kt` and
 * `EmbedAPI.android.kt` carried the matching `actual`s in the same shape. Counting read them as
 * live; diffing does not.
 *
 * The gap was therefore never a missing `actual`. It was dead code counted twice, and no amount of
 * re-counting would have found that -- which is why the check that replaces it is a set difference,
 * per platform, with the dead regions excluded by a scanner rather than by hope.
 *
 * ## The rule for a deprecated API: remove only when the Kotlin replacement is exact
 *
 * Issue #4 asks for the surface not to include deprecated APIs. Taken literally that deletes
 * capability, so the line drawn here -- and the line the one pre-existing case already drew -- is:
 *
 * - **Remove from `expect`/`actual`, keep the name as a `@Deprecated` shim**, when the shim is
 *   *exactly* the C function and not an approximation of it. `PyImport_ImportModuleNoBlock` (an
 *   exact alias of `PyImport_ImportModule` since 3.3) forwards; `PyEval_InitThreads` (an empty C
 *   body since 3.9) is a Kotlin no-op. Both are behaviour-preserving on every supported version.
 * - **Keep in the surface and annotate**, when the CPython replacement differs in reference
 *   contract or arity. `PyEval_GetBuiltins`/`GetLocals`/`GetGlobals` return *borrowed* references
 *   and their `PyEval_GetFrame*` replacements return *new* ones; `PyErr_Restore` takes the
 *   unnormalized `(type, value, traceback)` triple that `PyErr_SetRaisedException` cannot express.
 *   Deleting these would push callers onto a substitution that silently moves ownership, which is
 *   the class of bug that has already corrupted the heap in this repository once.
 *
 * Not covered by either: functions CPython documents as *discouraged* without deprecating --
 * `PyObject_HasAttr`, `PyObject_HasAttrString`, `PyMapping_HasKey`, `PyMapping_HasKeyString`,
 * `PyDict_GetItem`. Their KDoc says "for proper error handling, use the `WithError` variant", not
 * "deprecated", CPython names no removal schedule for them, and the error-swallowing behaviour is
 * what `PyDict.get` deliberately relies on ("null unambiguously means missing key here, not
 * error"). They stay, unannotated, on purpose.
 *
 * ## What each test claims
 *
 * - [theScannerSeesLiveCodeOnlyAndTheSurfaceIsNotVacuous] -- canaries at both ends, so that a
 *   scanner that has stopped working fails loudly instead of making every other test vacuous.
 * - [everyExpectHasAnActualOnEveryPlatform] -- the set difference §5c never performed. The Kotlin
 *   compiler already enforces this for the targets that are built, so this test's job is to state
 *   the answer in one place and to catch a platform that stops being compiled in CI.
 * - [noDeclarationIsStrandedInsideACommentedOutBlock] -- the dead-code guard. A declaration that
 *   exists *only* inside a comment is not a declaration; it is a trap for the next reader, and it
 *   was the direct cause of §5c's open question and of the JNI audit's phantom finding recorded in
 *   [JniCallConventionClassificationTest].
 * - [noCPythonDeprecatedSymbolIsInTheExpectSurface] -- the reclassification half of issue #4,
 *   derived from `Py_DEPRECATED(...)` in the CPython 3.13 headers bundled under
 *   `src/nativeInterop/cinterop/include`, not from anyone's memory of the deprecation schedule.
 * - [everyDocumentedDeprecationIsMarkedInKotlin] -- the softer half. CPython documents some
 *   deprecations only in prose ("Deprecated since version 3.13: use X instead"), and that prose is
 *   already in this repository, copied into the KDoc of the declaration it belongs to. Where the
 *   replacement is not a drop-in -- a different reference contract, a different arity -- the
 *   function stays in the surface and carries `@Deprecated` instead of being deleted out from under
 *   its callers. This test is what makes "carries `@Deprecated`" a rule rather than a habit.
 *
 * ## These assertions were watched failing before they were trusted
 *
 * Run against the tree as it stood at the start of this work (`develop` @ `3fde8bd6`):
 *
 * | test | result before the fix | why |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | [noDeclarationIsStrandedInsideACommentedOutBlock] | FAIL, 66 stranded declarations | 21 in `EmbedAPI.kt` (28-249), 22 in `EmbedAPI.android.kt` (30-73), 22 in `EmbedAPI.native.kt` (46-128), 1 in `EmbedAPI.desktop.kt` |
 * | [noCPythonDeprecatedSymbolIsInTheExpectSurface] | FAIL, `PyEval_InitThreads` | `ceval.h:114` marks it `Py_DEPRECATED(3.9)`, and its C body has been empty since 3.9 |
 * | [everyDocumentedDeprecationIsMarkedInKotlin] | FAIL, 5 unmarked | `PyEval_InitThreads`, `PyErr_Restore`, `PyEval_GetBuiltins`, `PyEval_GetLocals`, `PyEval_GetGlobals` |
 * | [everyExpectHasAnActualOnEveryPlatform] | PASS | it was already true; §5c's "20 missing" was an artefact of counting |
 *
 * The last row matters as much as the others: the honest result of the investigation is that half
 * of issue #4 was already done and the reported gap did not exist.
 *
 * That row is also the one that could have been vacuous, so it was mutated rather than trusted:
 * dropping `desktopMain` from [platforms] made it report "desktop is missing 314 actual(s)", which
 * is the whole surface. The set difference works; the tree was simply already correct.
