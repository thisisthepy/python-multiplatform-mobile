/**
 * ROADMAP §3 -- leaf vs re-entrant -- as something a machine re-derives on every run, instead of a
 * table in a markdown file that a human is supposed to keep in step with the code.
 *
 * The classification decides which JNI calling convention a function may be bound under.
 * `@FastNative` and `@CriticalNative` both stop the ART collector for the duration of the call, and
 * `@CriticalNative` gets no `JNIEnv`, so nothing underneath one may re-enter the runtime. A function
 * that can execute arbitrary Python -- a module's top-level code, a `__getattr__`, a `__del__`
 * reached by dropping the last reference -- must stay on ordinary JNI. Guessing wrong toward
 * ordinary costs 6-41 ns (`androidMain/README.md`); guessing wrong the other way is a crash, on a
 * device, once upcalls are live.
 *
 * Why this is a test and not a document: `docs/jni-call-convention-audit.md` classified 71
 * registrations, its own *Resolution* section re-read the table at 187, and the table this test
 * parses today holds a different number again. A hand-maintained classification is stale from the
 * next commit onward, and staleness in this particular table is invisible until it is a crash.
 *
 * ## What is derived and what is enumerated
 *
 * Derived from the CPython headers bundled in `src/nativeInterop/cinterop/include`, per
 * registration, by following the `JNINativeMethod` table into the C wrapper in `jni_onload.def` and
 * out to the CPython entry points that wrapper calls:
 *
 * - [Verdict.RE_ENTRANT_BY_SIGNATURE] -- a `PyObject *` (or thread/interpreter state) crosses the
 *   prototype of something it reaches. Then it can drop a reference, run a type slot, or allocate a
 *   GC-tracked object, and all three can reach `__del__`.
 * - [Verdict.RE_ENTRANT_BY_JNI_UPCALL] -- the wrapper dereferences `JNIEnv` and calls back into the
 *   runtime itself.
 * - [Verdict.LEAF_PROVEN] -- the wrapper body makes no call of any kind. This is the only leafness
 *   this file *proves*.
 * - [Verdict.UNDECIDED] -- everything else. **판정 불가.** No Python object crosses the signature, so
 *   the header cannot condemn it, and nothing available here can clear it either. `Py_Initialize`
 *   (`void Py_Initialize(void)`) and `PyRun_SimpleString` (`int PyRun_SimpleString(const char *)`)
 *   both land here, and both run arbitrary Python: a signature that mentions no `PyObject *` is not
 *   evidence of anything. [theSignatureRuleDoesNotClaimToProveLeafness] pins that down so nobody
 *   re-derives "unresolved entries: none", which is what the original audit claimed and what put
 *   three re-entrant functions on its safe-to-promote list.
 *
 * Enumerated, because it cannot be derived: [PROMOTED], the bindings allowed to carry a GC-blocking
 * convention. Every C API function can fail and CPython reports failure by allocating a GC-tracked
 * exception, so "provably cannot run Python" is not a property any of them has -- the honest test is
 * *leaf on the success path, and measured worth it*. Each entry carries its reason.
 *
 * [QUARANTINED] is the other enumerated set: declarations that are registered under a GC-blocking
 * convention, are re-entrant, and are kept only as benchmark twins. They are legal exactly as long
 * as nothing calls them, which is the invariant
 * [noLiveCallSiteReachesAGcBlockingBindingOutsideThePromotedSet] enforces.
 *
 * ## The parsers strip comments properly, and that is not a detail
 *
 * The audit's headline finding -- six re-entrant functions supposedly live under `@CriticalNative`
 * -- came from reading a block-commented region of dead pre-migration code as live. Two throwaway
 * parsers written while building this test reproduced the same class of error from the other side:
 *
 * - `bindings.kt` contains a banner line: two slashes followed by fifty asterisks. A parser that
 *   strips block comments before line comments finds a block-comment opener inside that banner and
 *   swallows 15 kB of live declarations -- 370 declarations read as 305, every `@FastNative` one
 *   gone.
 * - CPython's headers contain block comments whose last line holds a line-comment marker before the
 *   block terminator. Stripping line comments first eats the terminator, and then the block
 *   comment runs to the end of the next one -- `abstract.h` lost `PyNumber_FloorDivide` that way.
 *
 * So [stripComments] is a scanner, not a pair of regexes, and
 * [theParsersReadLiveCodeOnlyAndTheSurfaceIsNotVacuous] holds canaries at both ends.
 *
 * ## These assertions were watched failing before they were trusted
 *
 * The tree was already correct when this file was written, so every guard here would have passed
 * whether or not it worked. Each was therefore run against a deliberately broken tree first, and
 * each failure below was observed, not predicted:
 *
 * | mutation | failures |
 * |---|---|
 * | [PROMOTED] and [QUARANTINED] emptied -- the state before any classification existed | 3/10: the two set-membership guards and the call-site guard |
 * | `EmbedAPI.PyErr_Clear` moved from `bindings.PyErr_ClearN` to the `@CriticalNative` `bindings.PyErr_Clear` | 4/10, naming `PyErr_Clear called from [EmbedAPI.android.kt]` |
 * | `@FastNative` added to `PyDict_SetItemN`, which is re-entrant | same run, naming `PyDict_SetItemN -> f_PyDict_SetItemN RE_ENTRANT_BY_SIGNATURE` |
 * | [stripComments] replaced by the two regexes, block-first | 4/10; declarations read as 278 of 370, GC-blocking as 10 of 34 |
 * | the same two regexes, line-first | 1/10 -- and this is the interesting one: the suite stayed green apart from the `abstract.h` canary, while one registration slid from `RE_ENTRANT_BY_SIGNATURE` to `UNDECIDED` behind it |
 *
 * That last row is why the canaries are assertions rather than a comment. A parser that half-works
 * does not announce itself; it moves functions quietly into the bucket that asks fewer questions.
