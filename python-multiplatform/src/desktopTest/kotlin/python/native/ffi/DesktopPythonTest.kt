     * called `Py_Initialize()` and `Py_Finalize()` itself, which finalised the interpreter
     * mid-suite -- every test class scheduled after it then crashed inside `PyGILState_Ensure`
     * -> `new_threadstate`, reporting zero tests because the JVM died before any XML was
     * written. It went unnoticed while nothing happened to run afterwards.
     *
     * The interpreter is process-wide state. No single test owns its lifecycle.
