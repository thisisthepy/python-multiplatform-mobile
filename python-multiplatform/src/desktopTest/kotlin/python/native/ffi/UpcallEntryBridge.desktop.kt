/**
 * Desktop's half of `UpcallEntryTest`'s (`commonTest`) contract: a `ctypes` shim over the same
 * Panama upcall stubs [UpcallStub] builds for a real proxy method -- `restype=py_object` makes the
 * result readable from Python, and `CFUNCTYPE` (not `PYFUNCTYPE`) releases the GIL around the call,
 * which is the harder case and the one that segfaulted every C API call in the trampoline until it
 * stopped trusting the thread's nesting depth. The stub shape used for invocation, `(long, long)
 * -> long`, is deliberately the same one a `PyCFunction` slot needs (`PyObject
 * *(PyObject *self, PyObject *args)`): when the generated proxy type lands, `self` takes the
 * handle's place and no new stub shape is needed.
 *
 * Bootstrapping the three `ctypes.CFUNCTYPE`s is cheap enough to redo on every [bindUpcallOrNull]
 * call, which keeps this actual as thin as the others rather than adding its own install/cleanup
 * lifecycle.
