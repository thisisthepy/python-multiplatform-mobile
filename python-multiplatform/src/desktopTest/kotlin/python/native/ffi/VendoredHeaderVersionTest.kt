/**
 * The vendored CPython header tree under `src/nativeInterop/cinterop/include` must describe the
 * same CPython the build actually ships.
 *
 * ## Why this needs a test, when the build itself cannot drift
 *
 * For the *build*, headers and runtime cannot disagree: `build.gradle.kts` derives both the
 * `cinterop` include path and the linked library from the one `pythonVersion`/`libVersion` pair,
 * out of a single checksum-verified extraction (`docs/ecosystem.md`, "Version check (2026-08-17)").
 * `build.gradle.kts` never references `src/nativeInterop/cinterop/include` at all -- only
 * `.../cinterop/license` and `.../cinterop/lib`.
 *
 * The *evidence layer* is where the drift lives, and nothing enforced it. Two suites open that
 * vendored directory and treat its text as the truth about the C API:
 *
 * - [EmbedApiSurfaceTest] derives the `Py_DEPRECATED(...)` schedule the `expect` surface is
 *   checked against.
 * - [JniCallConventionClassificationTest] derives the `PyAPI_FUNC` prototypes that decide each
 *   JNI registration's call convention.
 *
 * The tree landed at `b184cba5`, before `pythonVersion` became a Gradle property, and its
 * `patchlevel.h` read `PY_VERSION "3.13.0+"` while `gradle.properties` had moved to `3.14.7`. A
 * function deprecated or re-signatured in 3.14 would have been classified from 3.13's text, and
 * both suites would have agreed with themselves -- passing, and wrong. No test could see it,
 * because no test compared the two versions.
 *
 * ## What this test does not claim
 *
 * It compares versions, not contents. It cannot tell you that the tree is a faithful copy of the
 * shipped headers, only that it claims the same version number. That is the cheap check that would
 * have caught the actual 3.13/3.14 split, and it is deliberately not more than that: a
 * content-level comparison would need the extraction present, which makes the check unavailable
 * exactly when the extraction has not been run.
 *
 * ## Watched failing before it was trusted
 *
 * Against the tree as it stood before the header refresh, this test reported:
 *
 * ```
 * expected:<[3.14.7]> but was:<[3.13.0]>
 * ```
 *
 * with the message naming `patchlevel.h`'s `PY_VERSION "3.13.0+"` against `gradle.properties`'s
 * `pythonVersion=3.14.7`. [theEvidenceThisTestReadsIsPresentAndNotVacuous] is the canary for the
 * other direction: a parser that silently found nothing would make the version comparison pass
 * for the wrong reason.
