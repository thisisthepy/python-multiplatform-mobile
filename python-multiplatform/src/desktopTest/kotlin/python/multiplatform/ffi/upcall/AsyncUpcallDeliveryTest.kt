/**
 * The delivery half of `docs/upcall-async-design.md` §5: candidate (C) as the surface Python sees,
 * candidate (B) as the mechanism underneath it.
 *
 * `PendingCallTest` already pins the half that starts the coroutine, and `AsyncCompletionProbeTest`
 * already measured the two facts the delivery depends on -- that a Kotlin-created thread can take
 * the GIL while the interpreter is parked in `run_until_complete`, and that `call_soon_threadsafe`
 * needs no binding that is not already in `EmbedAPI`. This is the thing built on top of both: an
 * exposed `suspend fun` that Python can `await`.
 *
 * ### What is deliberately driven from Python and not from Kotlin
 *
 * Two of these tests call the trampoline directly, because the fast path has no event loop in it
 * and calling it from Kotlin is the *stronger* statement -- there is no running loop anywhere in
 * this thread, so a call that reached the `asyncio` path at all would fail with "no running event
 * loop" instead of answering.
 *
 * The suspended path cannot be driven that way. `asyncio.get_running_loop()` answers for the
 * calling thread, and the loop's thread is inside `run_until_complete` for as long as it is
 * running, so the upcall has to arrive *from inside a coroutine*. That is what the `ctypes` bridge
 * (`UpcallEntryBridge.desktop.kt`) is for: `_pm_bound(...)` is the same `(long, long) -> long` stub
 * a generated proxy method would be wired to, reached through `CFUNCTYPE`, which drops the GIL
 * around the call exactly as the real boundary does.
 *
 * ### The Python-side wrapper is not test scaffolding
 *
 * `_await_kotlin` below -- "call it, and `await` the result only if the result is awaitable" -- is
 * the shape the generated Python proxy has to have, and it is what makes the fast path free:
 * `await kotlin_fn(x)` costs a `Future` only when the Kotlin body actually suspended. It is written
 * out here rather than generated because Python-side module generation does not exist yet
 * (`docs/upcall-async-design.md` §6, "Python 쪽 프록시가 `await` 를 이해하는 것").

     * ### Why the completer waits for two things and not one
     *
     * Waiting only for `loop.is_running()` is not enough, and the first version of this test found
     * that out by failing: the completer got the GIL the instant `CFUNCTYPE` dropped it *for the
     * upcall itself*, saw the loop running, and resumed the continuation while `AsyncUpcall.deliver`
     * was still deciding what to return. `PendingCall.isDone` was then already true and the boundary
     * took the fast path -- which is not wrong (the coroutine really had finished) but means the run
     * never touched the delivery path it was written to exercise.
     *
     * So the second condition is that Python has already *received* whatever the boundary handed
     * back (`_r['returned']` is set), which cannot happen before the `Future` exists and the
     * listener is attached. Both conditions are read under one GIL acquisition on a thread CPython
     * has never seen, which is also the contended-GIL observation `AsyncCompletionProbeTest`
     * established as the thing worth asserting.
     *
     * ### And why the resumption itself happens inside a GIL scope
     *
     * `PendingCall`'s contract (`commonMain/README.md`, and its own class doc) is that every
     * mutation happens on a thread holding the GIL -- that is what publishes `isDone` and `value` to
     * whoever reads them next. Resuming outside one, as the first version did, leaves the ordering
     * to whatever the GIL mutex happened to do. Real integrations owe the same discipline.
