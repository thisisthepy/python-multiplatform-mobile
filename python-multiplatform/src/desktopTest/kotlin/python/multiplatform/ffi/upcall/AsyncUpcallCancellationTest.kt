/**
 * What happens when the Python side gives up on a call that Kotlin is still running --
 * `docs/upcall-async-design.md` §8.6's first open question, which that section deliberately refused
 * to answer because it had not been measured.
 *
 * The shape of the problem is that the two halves of a suspended call are owned by different
 * languages. `Future.cancel()` is Python's, and it is *complete* the moment it is called: the
 * awaiting coroutine gets its `CancelledError` and the `Future` is settled forever. The Kotlin
 * coroutine knows nothing about any of that and keeps running, so its completion arrives at a
 * `Future` that will not take it. `set_result` on a cancelled `Future` raises `InvalidStateError`.
 *
 * The question worth asking is not whether that raise happens -- it does -- but **where it lands and
 * what it damages**. This repo has twice been bitten by a Python error indicator left set by one
 * call and then charged to an unrelated later one (`PyObject.getAttrOrNull`'s own comment records
 * the second time), so the assertions below are about the blast radius, not about the raise:
 *
 * - the loop's exception handler, which is where a callback that raises actually surfaces;
 * - the error indicator on the completing thread once delivery has returned;
 * - a subsequent, logically unconnected upcall.
 *
 * Every one of these is checked in a run that is *forced* to take the suspended path: a run where
 * the boundary answered synchronously would satisfy all of them while exercising nothing, so
 * `type(r).__name__` is asserted to be `Future` first, exactly as `AsyncUpcallDeliveryTest` does.
