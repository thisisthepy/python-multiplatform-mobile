/**
 * The half of cancellation `docs/upcall-async-design.md` §9.3 left undone: **early notice**.
 *
 * §9.3 established what cooperative cancellation can and cannot be here. `PendingCall.cancel()` is
 * a flag a body reaches through `ensureActive()`; it cannot stop a coroutine, because the
 * continuation that represents the body's current suspension point belongs to whoever created the
 * suspension and the stdlib offers no way to reach it. That much works. What did *not* work is that
 * the flag was only ever set from `AsyncUpcall.resolve` -- **at completion** -- so a body checking
 * `ensureActive()` in a loop kept looping for a result nobody would read, and only learned it had
 * been abandoned at the exact moment the news stopped being useful.
 *
 * That is the gap this pins. The design doc named the pieces it would take:
 *
 * > (a) `_pm_release` 와 같은 `(long) -> int` 스텁 하나, (b) `Future` 에 실어 보낼 `PendingCall`
 * > 핸들, (c) 다섯 타깃의 바인딩, (d) 그 핸들의 수명 관리
 *
 * ### What makes the observation a real one
 *
 * The assertion that matters is read **while the coroutine is still suspended**: `isCancelled` true
 * and `isDone` false, on a call whose continuation has not been resumed even once since the
 * cancellation. A test that only checked the flag afterwards would pass against the old behaviour
 * too, because the old behaviour set exactly that flag -- just too late for anybody to act on. The
 * two are told apart by *when*, so `when` is what is asserted.
 *
 * Every run is forced onto the suspended path first (`type(r).__name__ == 'Future'`), the same
 * guard `AsyncUpcallDeliveryTest` and `AsyncUpcallCancellationTest` use: the fast path would satisfy
 * a value assertion while exercising nothing.
 *
 * ### And the handle it costs
 *
 * Carrying the notice means Python holds a [HandleTable] handle on the [PendingCall] for as long as
 * the `Future` is unsettled, and that table **leaks by construction** -- it is a GC root nothing
 * reclaims on its own. So the reclamation is asserted on both outcomes, cancelled and completed
 * normally, and the fast path is asserted to register nothing at all: a `suspend fun` that never
 * suspends must not start paying for machinery it cannot use.
