/**
 * The measurement `docs/upcall-async-design.md` is built on, and the only one of its three
 * candidates that can be tested without writing the mechanism first.
 *
 * The design question every async upcall convention has to answer is not "can Kotlin start work"
 * -- it plainly can -- but **on what thread does the completion arrive, and may that thread touch
 * the interpreter.** Candidate (B) (Kotlin calls a Python callable on completion) and candidate
 * (C) (Kotlin resolves an `asyncio.Future`) both stand or fall on the same two facts, and both are
 * checkable here:
 *
 * 1. A thread **Kotlin** created -- not one CPython created, so nothing has ever given it a thread
 *    state -- can take the GIL and call Python while the interpreter's main thread is parked
 *    inside `loop.run_until_complete`.
 * 2. `loop.call_soon_threadsafe` is reachable through the bound ABI subset. It is not a special
 *    entry point: `PyImport_ImportModule`, `PyObject_GetAttrString` and `PyObject_Call` are all
 *    already in `EmbedAPI`, so (C) needs **no new binding**, which is the thing that was worth
 *    checking rather than assuming.
 *
 * ### Why the timeout is in Python and not in Kotlin
 *
 * If the completion never arrives, `run_until_complete` waits forever and takes the whole suite
 * with it. The guard is `loop.call_later`, scheduled on the loop itself, so a hang becomes a
 * recorded `TIMED_OUT` and an ordinary assertion failure rather than a stuck build. A Kotlin-side
 * timeout could not do this: the thread that would have to notice is the one that is stuck.
 *
 * ### What this deliberately does not show
 *
 * Desktop only. Android's completion thread is a JVM thread ART already knows, so the
 * attach-a-bare-pthread problem `409da6fc` solved for the *upcall* direction does not recur here;
 * that claim is reasoning, not a measurement, and is recorded as such in the design doc. wasm has
 * no threads at all and this test could not be written for it in any form -- which is itself the
 * finding.
