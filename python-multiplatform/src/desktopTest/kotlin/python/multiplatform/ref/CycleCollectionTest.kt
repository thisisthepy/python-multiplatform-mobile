 * Desktop's copy of the cycle-collection suite. The mechanism differs from the other two -- the

 * `artMain/cinterop/jni_onload.def` on ART -- so the three files are independent implementations
 * of the same claim rather than copies. See `commonTest/README.md`.
 *
 * ### `testDeallocOnAThreadCPythonCreated` and `testCycleCollectedOnAThreadCPythonCreated`
 *
 * `commonTest/README.md`'s comparison table recorded these as missing here, and unlike
 * [testHandleSurvivesWhenTraverseReportsNothing] (a same-mechanism placement gap) it called them
 * "a genuinely different question": whether a Panama upcall stub entered from a thread the JVM has
 * never seen -- a bare pthread `threading.Thread` spawns -- behaves the same as one entered from an
 * attached thread, which is not the same claim `AttachCurrentThreadAsDaemon` (ART) or an unattached
 * Kotlin/Native callback cover. Nothing in `ProxyTypeFactory.kt` or `Panama.kt` special-cases the
 * calling thread -- no `AttachCurrentThread` analogue is called anywhere in this backend -- so
 * whether it works was, before this file was extended, simply unverified. It works: both tests
 * below pass, which is the empirical answer `commonTest/README.md` left open.
 *
 * Adding them also brings the settle step the other two copies needed and this file's KDoc used to
 * explain the *absence* of, [settleJvmFinalisation]. `_t.start()`/`_t.join()` in both new tests
 * release the GIL, which is the one window a pending [java.lang.ref.Cleaner] release -- blocked in
 * `PyGILState_Ensure` with a `Py_DecRef` owed for some earlier test's leftover proxy -- can land in.
 * Landing there removes a reference from the proxy type between a test's two readings, and the test
 * then reports a `tp_dealloc` imbalance that does not exist, exactly as `643eaed9` (`nativeTest`)
 * and the `androidInstrumentedTest` copy both hit. [disposeProxy] and [settleJvmFinalisation] are
 * this file's copies of that fix, ported rather than newly designed.

     * The leak `tp_clear` cannot reach: a proxy that dies **without** being in a cycle.
     *
     * `tp_clear` only runs when the cyclic collector decides to break a loop, which is the
     * exceptional case. The ordinary one is a refcount reaching zero, and that goes straight to
     * `tp_dealloc` -- so with no `tp_dealloc` slot the [HandleTable] entry stays rooted for the
     * life of the interpreter, holding its Kotlin object with it. Almost every proxy dies this
     * way, so almost every proxy leaks.
     *
     * The [Node]s here deliberately reference nothing: `rawPtr` stays 0 and `ref` stays null, so
     * there is no cycle for the collector to find and `gc.collect()` is never called. The only
     * thing that can release these handles is `tp_dealloc`.
     *
     * ### The type refcount assertions
     *
     * `tp_dealloc` on a heap type has a second obligation beyond freeing the object: since 3.8
     * every instance holds a strong reference to its type, and the default `subtype_dealloc`
     * releases it. A hand-written `tp_dealloc` that forgets to leaks one type reference per
     * instance; one that releases it twice eventually frees the type out from under the process.
     * Both are checked here by reading the type's reference count out of its object header
     * directly. Reading it rather than calling `sys.getrefcount` keeps the argument's own
     * temporary reference out of the number.
     *
     * ### Two headers, not one
     *
     * `ob_refcnt` sits at offset 0 only on a build with the global lock. Free-threaded CPython
     * lays `PyObject` out differently (`Include/object.h`): offset 0 is `ob_tid`, the owning
     * thread's id, and the count is split between a thread-local `uint32 ob_ref_local` at +12 and
     * an atomic `Py_ssize_t ob_ref_shared` at +16 whose value is shifted left by
     * `_Py_REF_SHARED_SHIFT` (2). `Py_REFCNT` is the sum, and [typeRefCount] reproduces it.
     *
     * An earlier version of this probe read offset 0 unconditionally and therefore reported a
     * thread id on the free-threaded build -- the same ten-digit number for "before" and for
     * "alive", which is what the guard assertion below caught.
     *
     * ### Deferred references have to be materialised before the count means anything
     *
     * Fixing the offset is necessary and not sufficient. A heap type on the free-threaded build
     * carries `_PyGC_BITS_DEFERRED`, and its `ob_ref_shared` is initialised to the deferred
     * sentinel -- measured here on 3.14.7: `ob_gc_bits == 0x41` (`TRACKED | DEFERRED`) and
     * `ob_ref_shared == 0x3ffffffffffffffd`, i.e. a shared count of `PY_SSIZE_T_MAX / 8`. While
     * that bit is set, `PyType_GenericAlloc`'s `_Py_INCREF_TYPE` is a no-op for the owning thread,
     * so creating instances does not move the count at all. Measured: 100 instantiations left all
     * six header words bit-identical, and an eval-loop checkpoint
     * ([Python3.drainPendingReleases]) left them bit-identical too -- there is nothing queued to
     * merge, because the increments were never made.
     *
     * A collection is the one thing that converts deferred references into real ones. After
     * [PyGC_Collect] the same 100 instances show up as exactly 100 on the count, and `tp_dealloc`
     * then gives back exactly 100. So the invariant this test asserts does hold on both builds;
     * free-threaded it is simply not *observable* until a collection has run, which is why one is
     * taken on either side of the instantiation loop below. See
     * `docs/gc-scheduling-investigation.md`.
     *
     * The "rises while alive" assertion is not decoration: it is what proves the probe reads a
     * real refcount, so that the "returns afterwards" assertion cannot pass vacuously on a
     * garbage address -- and it is what caught both of the above.
