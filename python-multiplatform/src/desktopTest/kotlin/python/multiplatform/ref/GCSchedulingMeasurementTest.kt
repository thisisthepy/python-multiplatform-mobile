/**
 * Pins ROADMAP §9 / `docs/gc-scheduling-investigation.md` §1 and §7 on the **default (GIL)**
 * build specifically: `_PY_GC_SCHEDULED_BIT` is read only by the eval-loop checkpoint, on both
 * builds, so an embedder that never runs Python bytecode never runs the cyclic collector either
 * -- with or without free threading. `autoDrainInterval` is saved and restored around each test;
 * the default (0 on this build) is never changed by running this file.
 *
 * Also runs, unmodified, on `-PpythonFreeThreaded=true`, where the automatic checkpoint reliably
 * fires but does not reliably reclaim: under this heavy single-thread, C-API-only workload the
 * residue swings between the GIL build's ~1,970 and the full ~20,000, run to run, so only the GIL
 * build gets a bound. What *is* asserted on both builds is that the residue is ordinary
 * collectable cyclic garbage -- see [assertResidueIsOrdinaryCollectableGarbage] and the KDoc on
 * [measureCyclicGarbageWithAutoDrain].
 *
 * **Do not restore the inline `gc.get_objects()` chain.** Every temporary in it has to be closed;
 * the list holds the whole heap. See [countTrackedObjects].

     * The residue bound is pinned on the GIL build only, where it is stable at ~1,920-1,970 out of

     *
     * Free-threaded (`-PpythonFreeThreaded=true`, where `autoDrainInterval = 32` is already the
     * shipped default rather than something this test turns on) it is not stable, and no bound is
     * asserted. `CheckpointCounter.reached` climbs by an identical, deterministic amount on every
     * run, but the residue does not: measured 20,000 -- i.e. nothing reclaimed at all -- in 10 of
     * 12 repetitions, and 7,427 / 11,523 in the other two. The same configuration has also been
     * seen to **latch** within one JVM, reclaiming on the first repetitions and then never again
     * on the later ones. Any upper bound on this number would be a coin flip, so free-threaded
     * asserts only that the mechanism engages -- plus the one thing that *is* stable, below.
     *
     * ### What replaced the previous explanation
     *
     * This KDoc used to add that "a trailing explicit `gc.collect()` finds nothing further to
     * reclaim, so the residue is not simply garbage waiting for the next checkpoint", and
     * concluded from that a difference in the free-threaded collector's *reclaim* behaviour. That
     * was an artifact of this test's own measurement: the `gc.get_objects()` chain closed none of
     * its temporaries, and the leaked list holds a strong reference to every tracked object, so
     * the "residue" it reported was partly being held by the previous measurement. With the
     * temporaries released ([countTrackedObjects]), a trailing `gc.collect()` reclaims the residue
     * essentially completely on **both** builds -- 60+ repetitions, post-collection residue
     * between -13 and +2 -- and that is now asserted by
     * [assertResidueIsOrdinaryCollectableGarbage].
     *
     * So the residue *is* collectable garbage. What differs free-threaded is what makes the
     * collector run, not what it can reclaim, and that difference is not root-caused here. See
     * `docs/gc-scheduling-investigation.md` §8 for the measurements and the open question.
