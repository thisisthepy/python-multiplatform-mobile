/**
 * Pins the mechanism behind `docs/gc-scheduling-investigation.md` §8: why an eval-loop checkpoint
 * that demonstrably runs reclaims nothing on the free-threaded build, when the same checkpoint --
 * or three of them -- suffices with the global lock.
 *
 * It is not the checkpoint. Free-threaded, `_Py_RunGC` re-asks `gc_should_collect` *after* the
 * checkpoint has already read the scheduled bit, and it is that second question that answers no.
 * The relevant asymmetry in CPython 3.14.7, verified against the tagged source:
 *
 * | | global lock (`Python/gc.c`) | free-threaded (`Python/gc_free_threading.c`) |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | schedules on | `generations[0].count > threshold`, nothing else (`gc.c:1866`) | `gc_should_collect` (`:2153`) |
 * | re-checked when the checkpoint runs it | `gc_select_generation`, generation 0 on count alone (`gc.c:1258`) | `gc_should_collect` **again** (`:2328`) |
 * | process-memory gate | **none** -- `gc.c` has no `last_mem` and never calls `get_process_mem_usage` | `gc_should_collect_mem_usage` (`:2080`) |
 * | `long_lived_total / 4` | oldest generation only (`gc.c:1300`) | every generation-0 decision (`:2131`) |
 *
 * `gc_should_collect_mem_usage` compares the **whole process's** `phys_footprint`
 * (`task_info(TASK_VM_INFO)`, `:2010`) against `last_mem`, which is written only after a
 * collection (`:2301`). In a JVM-hosted embedder that number is JVM memory: ~20,000 small Python
 * lists cannot move it by the required `last_mem / 10`, so the gate stays shut no matter how many
 * checkpoints are taken, and it re-shuts itself by zeroing `young.count` into `deferred_count`
 * (`:2109`) on the way out. That is also the §8b latch -- once the JVM's footprint plateaus, the
 * condition can never become true again from the Python side.
 *
 * Both tests below are matched pairs: each manipulates something that the free-threaded source
 * says is load-bearing and the global-lock source says is irrelevant, and asserts exactly that
 * split. If CPython changes either gate, they fail and say which one.
