     * to point at a real prefix with a matching stdlib for `Py_Initialize` to get past
     * `encodings`. Loading the library out of that same prefix also removes a real hazard the
     * extraction path has: the stdlib comes from `PYTHONHOME` while the binary came from the jar,
     * so the two can disagree about the version.
     *
     * Only [LIBPYTHON_OVERRIDE_ENV] takes precedence over the classpath copy. The `PYTHONHOME`
     * probe runs *after* it, and only when the resource is absent, so a classpath deployment loads
     * exactly the library it always did.
