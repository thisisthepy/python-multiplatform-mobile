/**
 * What one upcall costs on **this** platform, priced against three things measured in the same run.
 *
 * `androidInstrumentedTest`'s `UpcallOverheadTest` did this for Android and answered the question
 * that target had -- whether the `AttachCurrentThreadAsDaemon` a Python worker needs is paid once
 * per thread or once per call. That question does not exist anywhere else: desktop, iOS,
 * androidNative and wasmJs all reach Kotlin without a second runtime to attach to. What *is* missing
 * everywhere else is the plain number, and without it the upcall path cannot be compared across
 * platforms the way `overhead/BenchmarkTest` lets the downcall path be compared.
 *
 * So this is the Android test with the attach half removed and nothing else changed: same loop
 * shape, same warmup counts, same three comparison baselines, same printed-not-asserted policy. It
 * lives in `commonTest` because every seam it needs is already common --
 * [python.native.ffi.bindUpcallOrNull] (`UpcallEntryTest`'s per-platform binding step),
 * [UpcallTrampoline], and the `expect` C API -- so one copy runs on all five targets, Android
 * included, and the Android row can be read next to the others from one source rather than two.
 *
 * ### The three baselines, and why a ratio needs all of them
 *
 * A per-call figure on its own says nothing: an emulator, a wasm host and a JVM do not share a
 * clock, a scheduler or an interpreter build. What travels between platforms is a *ratio* against
 * something measured on the same machine in the same run, and the three chosen here bracket the
 * boundary from both sides:
 *
 * - **`Py_IncRef` + `Py_DecRef`** -- two of the cheapest possible downcalls, so the floor of "cross
 *   the FFI boundary at all" on this platform.
 * - **`PyObject_CallObject` on a Python `def`** -- a downcall of the *same shape* as the upcall
 *   being measured: two integer arguments, one integer result, one callable. This is the
 *   denominator of the headline ratio.
 * - **`UpcallTrampoline.invoke` from Kotlin** -- the identical marshalling with the C shim and the
 *   platform boundary taken out. The gap between it and the Python-driven figure is what the
 *   boundary itself adds, with everything else held constant.
 *
 * The Python-side loop overhead (`_pm_time_loop`) and a pure-Python callee of the same shape
 * (`_pm_py_add`) are measured too, so the Python-driven numbers can be read net of what Python
 * charges for the loop and the call before anything crosses.
 *
 * ### The control the third baseline needs
 *
 * "Upcall minus trampoline = the boundary" is only true if the two differ by the boundary and
 * nothing else, and in the obvious arrangement they do not. [UpcallTrampoline] takes its own
 * `PyGILState_Ensure`/`Release` pair **unconditionally** -- it must, because a C caller may have
 * dropped the GIL inside a Kotlin scope that is still open -- so driving it from a bare Kotlin
 * thread pays a genuine GIL acquisition per call, while Python drives it already holding the GIL.
 * The first run of this test made that concrete: on iOS the trampoline came out *more* expensive
 * than the whole upcall through it, i.e. the "boundary cost" read as negative.
 *
 * So the trampoline is measured twice, differing in exactly that one thing -- caller holding
 * nothing, and caller inside a [withGIL] scope -- and an empty `Python3.withPython { }` is measured
 * beside them for scale. The second is the figure the boundary should be read against; the gap
 * between the two is this platform's GIL round trip, which is a cost of the *design* rather than of
 * the upcall path and is charged to downcalls just as much.
 *
 * ### One caveat that is real and is not measured away
 *
 * The Python-driven figures are timed *inside Python*, and what `_pm_bound` is differs by platform:
 * a `PyCFunction` built by a `PyMethodDef` on iOS/androidNative/Android, and on desktop a Python
 * `lambda *a: _pm_invoke(_pm_h, a)` over a `ctypes.CFUNCTYPE`. Desktop therefore pays one extra
 * Python call and ctypes' own argument conversion inside every figure below. `_pm_py_add` is the
 * scale of that extra call and is printed for exactly this reason; the ctypes conversion is on top
 * of it and is not separated here. Desktop's row is an upper bound on its boundary cost, not a
 * measurement of the boundary alone.
 *
 * ### Nothing here asserts a duration
 *
 * A wall-clock threshold would be a flake generator on a shared build machine, an emulator or a
 * Node host, and this repo has had exactly that failure. What is asserted is structural: the name
 * bound, the loop really called Kotlin (the result is checked), and every figure came back as a
 * usable positive number rather than a zero from a clock with no resolution -- which is the failure
 * mode that would otherwise be reported as "the upcall is free".

class UpcallBoundaryCostTest {

    private companion object {
        /** Calls per timed loop. Large enough to swamp the clock, small enough for the wasm host. */
        const val N = 10_000

        /**
         * Calls per row before any row is timed, and **the count is the measurement**.
         *
         * This was 3 000 -- the count the Android test used -- and at 3 000 this file did not
         * measure the boundary. It measured how warm the host's JIT happened to be when the row
         * ran, which is a property of *the rest of the suite* rather than of this commit. That is
         * not a hypothesis: `GeneratedProxyCostTest` became able to install proxies on wasmJs, which
         * put ~270 000 calls through the same entry point earlier in the same Node process, and this
         * file's wasm figure moved from 484-500 ns to 307-316 ns with the downcall column standing
         * still. Short-circuiting that one test at the same commit moved it back. Two of this
         * table's rows were published as boundary costs and neither reproduces.
         *
         * ### What is actually warming, established by sweep rather than argued
         *
         * The timed loops were run 40 times in succession, cold and warm, on both hosts. Per 10 000
         * calls, cold desktop read 1307, 716, 696, 660, 548, then flat at ~535; warm desktop read
         * 801, 744, 704, 705, 676, 602, 593, then flat at ~535. **The two configurations converge on
         * the same value**, and they converge from opposite sides -- so the plateau is a property of
         * the boundary and the pre-plateau readings are a property of the suite.
         *
         * The same sweep says what is warming, because two rows in it do not move at all: the empty
         * Python loop (8-9 ns) and the pure-Python callee (24-27 ns) are flat from the very first
         * 10 000 calls, on both hosts, cold and warm. So this is **not** CPython-side state -- not
         * the specializing interpreter, not free lists, not the allocator, not interning; all of
         * those would move the pure-Python rows too, and CPython's own paths are already at steady
         * state inside the first rep. Only the rows that cross into host code move. It is host JIT
         * tier-up: C2 on the JVM, and V8's tiering on wasm.
         *
         * ### Why this number and not a rounder one
         *
         * Convergence needed 40 000 calls cold and 70 000 warm on desktop, and 70 000 on wasm; the
         * warm side is slower to settle, so it sets the requirement. 100 000 is that 70 000 with
         * margin, and it is checked rather than assumed -- see the equality this file's figures are
         * required to hold in `docs/upcall-design.md`, where the same rows are quoted from a full
         * suite, from a suite with the proxy cost test short-circuited, and from a `--tests`-filtered
         * run of this class alone.
         *
         * Raising it is affordable because the warmup is bounded by the boundary cost it is warming:
         * eight rows of 100 000 calls is under a second per host, measured.
         *
         * `inline` on [Benchmark.measure] was tried and made this worse, which is worth recording so
         * it is not tried again: each inlined copy is separate code to the JIT and tiers up on its
         * own, and desktop's downcall row then needed ~230 000 iterations to reach the plateau it
         * reaches in ~50 000 through the shared, non-inlined loop.
