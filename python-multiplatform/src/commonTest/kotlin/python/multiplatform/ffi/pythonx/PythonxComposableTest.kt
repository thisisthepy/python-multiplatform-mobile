/**
 * `docs/pythonx-adapter-design.md` §5 from the Python end: **the `$default` mask is arithmetic
 * `pythonx` does, not a branch the generator emits.**
 *
 * ### Why the mask has to live here and not in the walker
 *
 * §4.5 measured the alternative and it does not fit: presence branching costs one generated call
 * expression per subset of the defaulted parameters, and `androidx.compose.material3.Text` defaults
 * fifteen. `ArtifactScanner.MAX_OMITTABLE_PARAMETERS` caps that at six for exactly this reason, so a
 * composable would never have been offered a single omission.
 *
 * What makes composables different is that `$default` is a **declared trailing parameter** of the
 * JVM method (§5.2), so it does not have to be a compile-time constant. Python knows which arguments
 * the caller wrote; that is one integer, computed once per call, for a declaration of any width.
 *
 * ### The encoding, and where it was read from
 *
 * Bit *i* means parameter *i* was omitted. Taken out of the callee's own prologue rather than
 * assumed -- `javap -c androidx/compose/material3/TextKt` shows `$default & 2` guarding
 * `modifier = Modifier.Companion`, `& 4` guarding `color = Color.Unspecified`, `& 8` the next one,
 * with a bit reserved for every parameter including the ones that default nothing. The same reading
 * is what [theMaskBitIsTheParameterIndex] pins from Python.
 *
 * ### What this test is not
 *
 * It is not a proof that Compose draws anything. The fragment behind it is Kotlin this repository
 * owns ([ComposableShapedFragment]), because `commonTest` runs on Kotlin/Native where there is no
 * Compose runtime and no generated thunk class. `:ksp-fixtures:compose`'s `ComposableRenderTest` is
 * the other half, and it renders a real `Text` through a real `Composer`.
