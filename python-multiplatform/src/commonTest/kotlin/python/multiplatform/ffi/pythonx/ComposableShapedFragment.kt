/**
 * A table shaped the way `ArtifactScanner` shapes a `@Composable`, backed by Kotlin this repository
 * owns.
 *
 * ### Why a stand-in
 *
 * Same judgement as [ComposeShapedFragment]'s, one step further along. The adapter under test is
 * `commonMain` Python, so its tests belong in `commonTest` where all five targets run them -- and a
 * real composable needs a JVM classpath, a Compose runtime, a live `Composer` and a generated thunk
 * class, none of which exist on Kotlin/Native. What is under test here is the *arithmetic*: which
 * `$default` bits a Python call sets, what goes in the slots it left out, and what `$changed` is.
 *
 * The real end of it -- `androidx.compose.material3.Text` drawing "hi" -- is
 * `:ksp-fixtures:compose`'s `ComposableRenderTest`, which is desktop-only for exactly those reasons.
 *
 * ### The shape, and why every field of it matters
 *
 * `Text(text, modifier = ..., color = ..., fontSize = ...)` reduced to four declared parameters and
 * the three synthetic groups a composable's JVM signature really carries
 * (`docs/pythonx-adapter-design.md` §5.2):
 *
 * | slot | name | tag | why |
 * |---|---|---|---|
 * | 0 | `text` | `STRING` | required: the one argument `Text('hi')` writes |
 * | 1 | `modifier` | `OBJECT` | defaulted, reference: its absent value must be `null` |
 * | 2 | `color` | `INT` | defaulted, **value class erased to a primitive**: its absent value must be `0`, not `None`, or the thunk's `Number.intValue()` would raise |
 * | 3 | `fontSize` | `INT` | a second defaulted slot, so a mask with two bits set is distinguishable from one with either |
 * | 4 | `$composer` | `OBJECT` | the value Python cannot invent |
 * | 5 | `$changed` | `INT` | must arrive as `0` -- the conservative claim |
 * | 6 | `$default` | `INT` | the mask, which is the whole point |
