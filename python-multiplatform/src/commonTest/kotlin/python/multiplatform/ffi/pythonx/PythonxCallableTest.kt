/**
 * The direction the composable work left open: **a Python callable reaching a Kotlin function-typed
 * parameter.**
 *
 * `docs/pythonx-adapter-design.md` §6 states the starting position exactly -- "a Python callable can
 * already cross into Kotlin", as a `PyObject`, because `UpcallTrampoline.toKotlinObject` wraps
 * anything that is not an integer handle. What it *cannot* do is arrive as a `Function0` or a
 * `Function3`, which is what every container composable's `content` slot is after the Compose plugin
 * has lowered it. So `Column`, `Row`, `Box` and `Button` were reachable only with `content` left
 * defaulted, which for `Column` is not reachable at all -- `content` declares no default.
 *
 * ### The three questions, and which one this file answers
 *
 * | | where |
 * |---|---|
 * | does a Python callable become a Kotlin `FunctionN`, with the composer threaded through | here, on all five targets, against [ComposableShapedFragment] |
 * | does a real `androidx.compose.foundation.layout.Column` then draw its content | `:ksp-fixtures:compose`'s `ComposableRenderTest`, desktop only |
 * | does Compose give the callable back when it drops the slot | `ComposableRenderTest.aDisposedCompositionGivesEveryPythonCallableBack`, because `RememberObserver` is a Compose type |
 *
 * The split is [ComposableShapedFragment]'s: `commonTest` runs where there is no Compose runtime, no
 * `Composer` and no generated thunk class, so what is checked here is the mechanism -- which object
 * arrives, what it does when invoked, and who holds the Python reference -- and not the pixels.
 *
 * ### Lifetime is the risk, and it is asserted from both sides
 *
 * A test that only counted leaks would pass a double release, which is the failure this repository
 * has actually been bitten by (`agent-rules` §14: two wrappers decrementing one pointer corrupted
 * the heap and surfaced in an unrelated test). So [theScopeHoldsThePythonCallableAndGivesItBackOnce]
 * asserts the reference count **goes up** while the scope is open, **comes back** when it closes,
 * and **does not go below the baseline** when close is called again.
