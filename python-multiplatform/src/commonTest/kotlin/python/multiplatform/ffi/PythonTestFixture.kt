/**
 * Shared entry point for functional tests that need a live interpreter.
 *
 * A real CPython 3.13 interpreter *does* initialise inside this test binary
 * on the platforms this suite currently runs on (see
 * `python.multiplatform.env.InterpreterAvailabilityTest`, and the
 * `extractIosSimulatorStdlib` task in `build.gradle.kts` that gives the iOS
 * simulator run a `PYTHONHOME` with an actual standard library to find). So
 * [withInterpreter] is the primary, expected-to-succeed path: it initialises
 * eagerly and lets any failure propagate as a real test failure.
 *
 * [requireInterpreterOrSkip] is a defensive fallback for environments where
 * bringing up the interpreter is not guaranteed at all (e.g. a future target
 * with no stdlib payload wired up yet) -- it degrades to a clearly-labelled
 * skip instead of a wall of unrelated crashes, rather than being the normal
 * way tests in this suite are expected to run.
