 * properties (`version`/`platform`/`copyright`/`compiler`/`buildInfo`).

     * protect: **the interpreter this whole suite shares is still there afterwards.**
     *
     * The history, because it is the reason the property is worth a test of its own: the original
     * body did `sys.argv[1] = ...` -- an assignment to an index that need not exist -- through
     * `PyRun_SimpleString`, which prints and clears the error indicator, so the resulting
     * `IndexError` was invisible; and then called `Py_RunMain()`, which **always finalizes the
     * interpreter**, leaving the process with a torn-down runtime while [Python3.isInitialized]
     * still said `true`. Nothing in `src/` or `sample/` called it, so it never fired.
     *
     * The replacement goes through `runpy.run_module(..., run_name="__main__", alter_sys=True)`,
     * which touches no lifecycle function at all. `RunMainTest` covers what it does; this covers
     * what it must not do.
     *
     * Red phase: the refusal it replaces threw `UnsupportedOperationException` from every call,
     * so this failed with that exception before the implementation landed (observed alongside the
     * twelve `RunMainTest` cases). The pre-*refusal* body's red phase is still the one thing here
     * that cannot be run -- `Py_RunMain()` with no `PyConfig.run_*` set enters the REPL on the
     * process's stdin and finalizes the shared interpreter, which hangs the worker or crashes
     * every class scheduled after it.
