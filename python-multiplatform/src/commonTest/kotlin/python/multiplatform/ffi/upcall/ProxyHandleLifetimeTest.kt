/**
 * Who gives a [HandleTable] root back, and when.
 *
 * [HandleTable]'s own class doc states the contract and then says nobody was keeping it: *"This
 * table leaks by construction. Every entry is a strong reference the Kotlin GC can see and Python
 * cannot; nothing here can tell that the Python proxy has died. The proxy's `tp_dealloc` calling
 * `release` is the entire lifetime contract."* [PythonProxySource] renders the proxy that was
 * supposed to do the calling, and until this test existed it rendered an `__init__` that took a
 * handle and no path at all that gave one back.
 *
 * **This was observed before it was fixed, not inferred.** `GeneratedProxyCostTest`'s constructor
 * row calls `Counter(10)` ten thousand times and throws every result away; the run ended with
 * **78 002 live handles** on desktop, i.e. every single object Python had finished with was still
 * rooted in Kotlin. The measurement noticed because its own fixture moved underneath it -- the two
 * constructor rows were each timed against a table that had grown by tens of thousands of entries
 * while they ran, and desktop's constructor delta swung either side of zero between runs.
 *
 * ### Both ends of the count, always
 *
 * Every assertion here checks `baseline + N` **and** `baseline`. Checking only the second would
 * pass just as well if the constructor had stopped registering anything at all, which is a
 * different bug wearing the same green tick -- `docs/object-lifetime.md` and this repository's
 * early-cancellation work both record that lesson already. The `baseline + N` assertion is what
 * says the root was really taken, and it is the reason a regression that silently stopped rooting
 * receivers would fail here rather than look like an improvement.
 *
 * ### Cycles
 *
 * A proxy that is part of a reference cycle is collected by CPython's cyclic collector rather than
 * by refcounting, and `__del__` is the historically unreliable hook for that case (uncollectable
 * before PEP 442, and silently overridable by a subclass at any time). [testProxyInACycle] is what
 * pins the choice of `weakref.finalize` instead: it builds a cycle deliberately, drops the only
 * external reference, runs `gc.collect()`, and requires the handles back.
 *
 * ### The raw boundary is a different contract, and is not tested here as if it were the same one
 *
 * `_pm_invoke(ctor_handle, ...)` hands back a bare integer. There is no Python object for a
 * finaliser to hang off, so the **caller** owns that handle and must pass it to `_pm_release`; that
 * is what [testRawHandleIsTheCallersToRelease] pins. `GeneratedProxyCostTest`'s raw constructor row
 * was not doing it, which is the harness half of the same 78 002.
 *
 * ### wasmJs
 *
 * This said "no proxies are installable there at all, so there is no proxy whose lifetime could be
 * asserted", and it is now the fifth target that runs every assertion below -- see
 * [publishesProxyEntryPoints]. That matters more here than the sync contracts do: `__del__` reaches
 * Kotlin through the published `_pm_release`, which on wasm is a `PyCFunction` over the *same*
 * exported pointer as `_pm_invoke` with a different op code in its `self`. A dispatcher that routed
 * a release to the invoke path would leak every handle silently, and this file is what says it does
 * not.
