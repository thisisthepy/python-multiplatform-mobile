/**
 * The half of `docs/upcall-async-design.md` that every candidate shares: starting a Kotlin
 * coroutine from a frame that must return synchronously, and parking its outcome somewhere the
 * boundary can address later.
 *
 * Nothing here touches CPython, which is the point -- this is pure Kotlin and therefore the same
 * on all five targets, so it belongs in `commonTest` rather than in a platform suite. What is
 * *not* here is the delivery half (polling, a Python callback, or an `asyncio.Future`); that is
 * the part the design doc leaves unbuilt, and `AsyncCompletionProbeTest` in `desktopTest` is the
 * measurement standing in for it.
 *
 * The suspension points are `kotlin.coroutines.suspendCoroutine` and the continuations are
 * resumed by hand. That is deliberate: it needs no `kotlinx.coroutines` dependency (the library
 * has none, and `PendingCall` must not introduce one), and it makes "suspended" and "resumed"
 * two separate lines of the test rather than a scheduling race.
