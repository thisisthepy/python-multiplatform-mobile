/**
 * Who owns the [HandleTable] root behind a `TypeTag.OBJECT` **result**, when the entry that
 * produced it is a plain [CallableKind.FUNCTION].
 *
 * [ProxyHandleLifetimeTest] already pins the two contracts that existed: a *constructor* proxy owns
 * its handle and gives it back in `__del__`, and a handle taken over the *raw* boundary is the
 * caller's to release by hand. This file is about the third case, which had no owner at all.
 *
 * ### What was leaking, measured rather than argued
 *
 * `docs/kotlin-extensions-in-python.md` §3.2 assembles `Modifier.padding(16.dp).size(24.dp)` from
 * Python out of Compose's own jars. Every link of that chain is a `CallableKind.FUNCTION` returning
 * `TypeTag.OBJECT`, so [UpcallTrampoline.marshalResult] registered a root and handed Python a bare
 * integer -- and an integer has nothing to hang a finaliser off. §6's "Handle ownership" records the
 * consequence: *"A chained `Modifier.padding(...).size(...)` leaks one handle per intermediate link
 * until §4.1's proxy exists to own them."* `WalkedArtifactComposeModifierTest` says the same thing
 * about itself: three handles per run, deliberately.
 *
 * A chain is not a synthetic shape. Compose modifiers are written long, so the leak is proportional
 * to how idiomatic the calling code is.
 *
 * ### Why the count, and not "it did not crash"
 *
 * Every assertion here reads [HandleTable.liveCount] and checks **both ends**: `baseline + N` while
 * Python still holds the objects, and `baseline` once it has dropped them. Only the second is the
 * leak; checking only the second would pass just as well if the boundary had stopped rooting
 * anything at all, which is the opposite defect wearing the same green tick. That is the same rule
 * [ProxyHandleLifetimeTest] states and it is not restated here so much as inherited.
 *
 * ### The three things that could go wrong instead, and the test for each
 *
 * | | test |
 * |---|---|
 * | the root is never taken, so nothing is owned and `resolve` fails later | the `baseline + N` half of every assertion |
 * | the root is taken twice or given back twice -- a double release, which hands one slot to two owners | [releasingAnOwnedResultTwiceDoesNotFreeTheSlotsNewOwner] |
 * | an entry whose producer did **not** name its return type silently starts being owned | [anEntryWhoseProducerDidNotNameItsReturnKeepsTheBareHandleContract] |
 *
 * The last one is the reason the ownership is gated on [ExposedCallable.returnTypeName] rather than
 * on [TypeTag.OBJECT] alone. `OBJECT` is two things at once in the *result* direction, exactly as it
 * is in the argument direction: [UpcallTrampoline] answers with a `HandleTable` integer for a Kotlin
 * object and with the Python object itself for a `PyObject`, and Python cannot tell those apart when
 * the second one happens to be an `int`. Wrapping such a value would make `__del__` release a handle
 * nobody issued. The walker supplies a return type name (`WalkedArtifactComposeModifierTest`
 * asserts `androidx.compose.ui.Modifier`); the KSP processor does not supply one at all, so every
 * KSP entry keeps the bare-handle contract it has today and nothing about that path moves.
