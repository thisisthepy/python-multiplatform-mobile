/**
 * The part of the async boundary that works on **every** target, pinned where every target compiles
 * and runs it.
 *
 * `AsyncUpcallDeliveryTest` is `desktopTest` because delivery needs a second thread: the upcall has
 * to arrive from inside a coroutine while a Kotlin thread resolves the `Future`. That shape is not
 * portable. What is portable is the half of `docs/upcall-async-design.md` §5 that the doc calls the
 * fast path -- `suspend` is a signature, not a promise to suspend, and a body that never reaches a
 * suspension point must cross **without asyncio being involved at all**.
 *
 * That claim is worth a portable test precisely because of what was measured below.
 *
 * ### wasmJs: measured, and worse than §8.5 predicted
 *
 * §4 and §8.5 expected candidate (C) to fail on wasmJs by *deadlock* -- Kotlin's resumption arriving
 * as a JS microtask that `run_until_complete` never yields to. That is not what happens, and the
 * real answer arrives much earlier than the await:
 *
 * ```
 * import json        OK        import math         OK
 * import select      OK        import socket       OK
 * import contextvars OK        import selectors    RuntimeError: unreachable  <- traps
 * import asyncio.events / asyncio.base_events / asyncio   traps, through selectors
 * ```
 *
 * `import asyncio` **traps the wasm instance**, killing the Node process rather than raising a
 * Python exception. So on wasmJs candidate (C) is not slow, or deadlocked, or degraded: its first
 * step is unavailable, and the failure is not catchable from Kotlin or from Python. The deadlock
 * §8.5 reasoned about is unreachable because nothing gets that far.
 *
 * The consequence for this file is direct: **the "suspended with no running loop" case cannot live
 * in `commonTest`.** It reaches `asyncio.get_running_loop`, so on wasmJs it takes the whole suite
 * down with it -- observed, which is how the trap above was found. It stays in `AsyncUpcallDeliveryTest`
 * (desktop), and what is asserted here is only what is genuinely portable: the paths that return
 * before any import happens. Both of those matter more than the failing one, because they are the
 * ones an application on wasmJs can actually rely on.
