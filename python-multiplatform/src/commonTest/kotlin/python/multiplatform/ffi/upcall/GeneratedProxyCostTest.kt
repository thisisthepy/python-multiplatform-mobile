/**
 * What the *generated proxy* costs, on top of the boundary `UpcallBoundaryCostTest` already prices.
 *
 * That test answers "what does one upcall cost", and its answer is a `_pm_invoke(handle, args)`
 * called straight from Python. **Nobody writes that.** What a user writes is `demo.calc.ping()`,
 * `Counter(10).increment(5)`, `c.value`, `Counter.created`, `await g.fetch()` -- and each of those
 * goes through a layer of generated Python that the boundary figure says nothing about: a global
 * lookup, a bound-method dispatch, an argument tuple built one element longer to carry the receiver,
 * a `property` descriptor, a metaclass descriptor, or an `async def` wrapper with a `hasattr` in it.
 *
 * So this is `UpcallBoundaryCostTest`'s shape applied one level up. It follows that test's design
 * deliberately and in full, because that design has already been argued and validated:
 *
 * - **every baseline is measured in the same run**, on the same machine, in the same thermal state.
 *   A ratio against a remembered number is not a measurement.
 * - **the same warmup count as the measured loop, in the same shape**, run first. An unwarmed first
 *   row in this repository once made a subset of the work look cheaper than the whole of it.
 * - **nothing asserts a duration.** A wall-clock threshold on a shared build machine, a simulator or
 *   a Node host is a flake generator and this repository has had exactly that failure. What is
 *   asserted is structural: the proxies returned the right values, the async row really took the
 *   fast path (zero `Future`s constructed), and every figure came back positive rather than a zero
 *   from a clock with no resolution.
 *
 * ### The harness, and why every row has the same shape
 *
 * Every row is a **zero-argument Python function** called `N` times by one shared timing loop, so
 * each row pays exactly one identical loop iteration plus one identical zero-arg call. The floor row
 * ([NOOP]) is that and nothing else, so *row minus floor* is the body and only the body. Rows are
 * not comparable to each other any other way: a `lambda` here and an inlined expression there would
 * differ by a Python call frame, which on the fast targets is a fifth of the whole figure.
 *
 * The **global lookups stay inside the timed body on purpose**, because they are part of what the
 * user pays: `demo.calc.tally` really is a module attribute access, and `c.increment(5)` really does
 * resolve `increment` on the instance before it calls anything. The one thing hoisted out is the
 * receiver handle in the raw rows (`_pc_self = _pc_c._pm_handle`), because there the attribute lookup
 * is exactly the overhead being measured and leaving it in both halves would cancel it out of the
 * answer.
 *
 * ### The two floors, and why a Python-only one is needed
 *
 * A proxy property read is a descriptor *and* a boundary crossing. Priced against the raw boundary
 * alone, the descriptor and the extra Python frame are indistinguishable from each other. So a pure
 * Python class with a plain attribute and a `@property` over a constant is measured beside them:
 * that is what CPython charges for the descriptor machinery with no Kotlin anywhere, and the proxy's
 * excess over the raw boundary should land near it if the generated shape is not doing anything
 * unusual.
 *
 * ### What this test has already found
 *
 * A top-level Kotlin `val`/`var` read cost **551-587 ns more than the boundary call underneath it**
 * on desktop, while every other generated surface -- including the metaclass descriptor doing the
 * same job for a class static -- cost between 2 and 82 ns more. That was not noise and it was not
 * the boundary: [PythonProxySource] answered a module attribute with a `__getattr__` hook, which
 * CPython consults only *after* `module_getattro` has built and raised the formatted "module has no
 * attribute" `AttributeError` for the hook to catch and throw away. One raised exception per read.
 * Replacing it with a `property` on a per-module type -- the same data-descriptor shape the class
 * statics already used -- moved that row to 16-29 ns, in line with everything else.
 *
 * The measurement is what found it. Nothing about the two shapes differs in behaviour, both pass
 * `PythonProxyInstallTest` unchanged, and reading the generated source tells you nothing about the
 * cost of either.
 *
 * It has also found something that is not a cost at all. The constructor row was **unmeasurable on
 * desktop** -- its delta swung either side of zero between runs while no other row's did -- because
 * both halves of the pair rooted a Kotlin object in [HandleTable] per call and neither gave it
 * back. The run ended with **78 002 live handles**, and every row in the report had been timed
 * against a table that grew by tens of thousands of entries while it ran. Two different defects
 * wore that one number: the generated proxy class had no `__del__` at all, which is a library bug
 * ([PythonProxySource], `ProxyHandleLifetimeTest`); and this file's *raw* constructor row never
 * released the bare handle the boundary had handed it, which is the caller's to release and is a
 * bug in the harness. The `assertEquals(handlesBefore, handlesAfter)` below is what keeps either
 * from coming back silently.
 *
 * ### wasm
 *
 * This section used to read "there are **no generated proxies on wasmJs** and there structurally
 * cannot be", and the sync rows above now print real figures for that target. What changed is not
 * the export constraint -- `@WasmExport` is still honoured only in the application's own
 * compilation -- but the observation that one export was already enough: a `PyCFunction` carries a
 * `self` as well as a function pointer, so the single `pmp_invoke` backs all five entry points, told
 * apart by an op code where a handle would otherwise sit. See [publishesProxyEntryPoints] and
 * `wasmJsMain`'s `UpcallEntry`.
 *
 * ### `import asyncio` and the wasm precedent
 *
 * `AsyncUpcallPortabilityTest` records that `import asyncio` does not raise on this wasm build --
 * it **traps the instance**, killing the process. That did not change with the bootstrap, so the
 * await row below sits behind [proxyBootstrapSupportsAsyncio] instead: the sync rows run on wasm,
 * and the one row that needs an event loop returns before any `import` happens, exactly as
 * `PythonProxyInstallTest`'s own asyncio-using test does.

         * [python.native.ffi.UpcallBoundaryCostTest] needs and is still enough.
         *
         * That file's sweep established the quantity both files depend on: the host JIT needs
         * ~70 000 calls through the boundary before the figure stops falling, on desktop and on wasm
         * alike, and below that a row reports how warm the process happened to be rather than what
         * the call costs. What protects this file is [timeAll]'s shape -- every row is warmed, then
         * every row is timed -- so the *shared* `_pm_invoke` path receives 19 x WARMUP before the
         * first row is measured, while each row's own Python function only has to warm its own

         * other's per-row count, which it does not need. Measured at 3 000, this file's raw rows
         * already agreed to within 3-7% between a solo run and the full suite, because of the shape
