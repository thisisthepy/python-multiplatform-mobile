 * and clears a `WeakRef` only once the job that created it has ended, so **nothing** is observable
 * from inside a single synchronous test body there. Spinning in a loop on that target measures a
 * turn of the event loop that cannot advance -- which is what these three cases used to do, and why
 * they read as "wasm has no finalisation hook" long after one had been wired up.
 *
 * `kotlin-test`'s wasm adapter awaits a returned `Promise`; that was verified with a test returning
 * `Promise.reject`, which failed. `WasmFinalizationTest` keeps a standing control for it so a
 * regression cannot turn these assertions into ones nobody runs.
