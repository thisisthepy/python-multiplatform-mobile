 * `python.multiplatform.currentThreadId()`, an `expect fun` in `nativeMain` with a Darwin `actual`
 * (`iosMain`, the pointer's bit pattern) and a Bionic `actual` (`artMain`, the integer as-is) --

     * The leak `tp_clear` cannot reach: a proxy that dies **without** being in a cycle.
     *
     * Ported from `desktopTest`, and it is the case that matters most in practice. `tp_clear` only
     * runs when the cyclic collector decides to break a loop, which is the exceptional path. The
     * ordinary one is a refcount reaching zero, and that goes straight to `tp_dealloc` -- so with
     * no `tp_dealloc` slot the [HandleTable] entry stays rooted for the life of the interpreter,
     * holding its Kotlin object with it. Almost every proxy dies this way.
     *
     * The [CycleNode]s here deliberately reference nothing: `rawPtr` stays 0 and `ref` stays null,
     * so there is no cycle for the collector to find and `gc.collect()` is never called. The only
     * thing that can release these handles is `tp_dealloc`.
     *
     * ### The type refcount assertions
     *
     * `tp_dealloc` on a heap type has a second obligation beyond freeing the object: since 3.8
     * every instance holds a strong reference to its type, and the default `subtype_dealloc`
     * releases it. Kotlin/Native's `proxyDealloc` hand-writes that (`PyObject_Type` for the
     * temporary, then two `Py_DecRef`s), so it can leak one type reference per instance by
     * forgetting, or free the type out from under the process by doing it twice. Both are checked
     * by reading `ob_refcnt`, the first field of `PyObject` and fixed there by the stable ABI --
     * `sys.getrefcount` cannot be used because it counts its own argument's temporary.
     *
     * The "rises while alive" assertion is not decoration: it is what proves the probe reads a
     * real refcount, so the "returns afterwards" assertion cannot pass vacuously on an address
     * that happens to hold a stable number.
