 * exception. Without this slot every such proxy left its [HandleTable] entry rooted for the life
 * of the interpreter, holding a Kotlin object nothing could reach again.
 *
 * Unlike `tp_clear`, this one owns the object's memory. Installing it replaces CPython's
 * `subtype_dealloc` outright, so everything that function does for a GC'd heap type has to happen
 * here:
 *
 *  - **untrack first.** The type carries `Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_GC`, so the instance is on the
 *    collector's list; freeing it while still linked leaves the collector walking released memory.
 *  - **free through the type's own `tp_free`.** `PyType_GetSlot` is the only abi3 route to it,
 *    and the type must come from the *instance* rather than from [proxyTypeAddress]: the type is
 *    declared `Py_TPFLAGS_BASETYPE`, so Python code may subclass it and inherit this function.
 *  - **release the instance's reference to its type.** Since 3.8 an instance of a heap type holds
 *    one and `subtype_dealloc` gives it back. Forgetting leaks the type once per instance; doing
 *    it twice frees the type while it is still in use.
 *
 * `Py_TYPE` is a macro, so the type is fetched with `PyObject_Type`, a real stable-ABI function
 * that returns a *new* reference. Hence the two decrements: one for that temporary, one for the
 * instance's own.
 *

/**
 * The Kotlin/Native half of the cycle-collecting proxy type.
 *
 * Lives in `nativeMain` rather than `iosMain` because `nativeMain` is shared with androidNative;
 * an actual under `iosMain` alone leaves the androidNative compilation without one, and the
 * failure reads as "expect declaration has no actual in module <commonMain> for Native" from a
 * target nobody was building.
 *
 * ### How this differs from desktop
 *
 * Desktop builds the two C function pointers with Panama upcall stubs, which can close over a
 * `MethodHandle` and therefore over arbitrary state. Kotlin/Native's equivalent,
 * [staticCFunction], deliberately cannot: it takes only a non-capturing function, so the type
 * pointer the slots need to call `PyObject_GetTypeData` cannot be captured and has to be reached
 * as a global ([proxyTypeAddress]).
 *
 * Everything else is easier here than on desktop. `PyType_Spec` and `PyType_Slot` come out of
 * cinterop as real structs, so the spec is filled in by field name instead of by hand-computed
 * offsets through `sun.misc.Unsafe`.
 *
 * ### Threads CPython created
 *
 * The slots used to be reached only from a thread that already runs Kotlin -- the one that called
 * `gc.collect()` -- and a [staticCFunction] entered from a thread the Kotlin/Native runtime has
 * never seen is a different situation. Nothing here handles it explicitly, and it turns out
 * nothing has to: `CycleCollectionTest.testCycleCollectedOnAThreadCPythonCreated` and
 * `testDeallocOnAThreadCPythonCreated` run the collection, and the last-reference drop, on a
 * `threading.Thread` -- a bare pthread the runtime never created -- and all three slots work
 * there. The tests do not infer the thread from the effect: the `traverse` lambda they register
 * records `pthread_self()` and they assert it differs from the test thread's.
 *
 * Verified on `iosSimulatorArm64Test`, 195 tests, 0 failed. The androidNative build shares this
 * file but has no test run of its own, so read the result as "the new memory model attaches a
 * runtime to a foreign thread on entry", not as a per-target measurement.
 *
 * ### `tp_dealloc`, measured
 *
 * `CycleCollectionTest.testHandleReleasedWhenProxyDiesWithoutCycle` drops 100 cycle-free proxies
 * and checks both that their handles are released and that [proxyDealloc]'s two `Py_DecRef`s
 * balance -- it reads the type's `ob_refcnt` directly, so a forgotten release (type leaks per
 * instance) and a doubled one (type freed while in use) are told apart rather than lumped
 * together.
