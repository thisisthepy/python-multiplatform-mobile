/**
 * The Kotlin/Native half of the upcall boundary: the few lines that give Python the *address* of
 * an entry point. All of the marshalling is in [UpcallTrampoline], which is `commonMain`.
 *
 * Lives in `nativeMain` rather than `iosMain` because `nativeMain` is shared with androidNative;
 * putting it under `iosMain` leaves the androidNative compilation without it, which is the exact
 * failure `nativeMain/README.md` warns about. Nothing here is Android-shaped, so nothing here
 * belongs in `artMain`.
 *
 * ### Two routes, because the documented one only half exists
 *
 * `docs/upcall-design.md` named one route for this platform -- a `@CName` symbol picked up by
 * `ctypes.CDLL(None)`, on the grounds that Python and Kotlin/Native are one binary so no C glue
 * is needed. Checked, and it holds in one of the three binaries this project produces:
 *
 * | Binary | `pm_upcall_invoke` |
 * |---|---|
 * | androidNative `libmultiplatform_python3.14.so` | exported (`T` in `nm -D`) |
 * | iOS `PythonMultiplatform.framework` | **absent** -- a framework's export set is the Objective-C surface plus the Konan runtime; a `@CName` alias is not in it |
 * | Kotlin/Native test executable (either target) | **absent**, and absent from the per-file caches too, so it is never emitted rather than dropped at link time |
 *
 * And on iOS the other half fails independently: this project's `Python.framework` has **no
 * `_ctypes`** (it exports `PyInit__abc` through `PyInit_time` and ships no `lib-dynload`), so
 * `import ctypes` raises `ModuleNotFoundError` and nothing on that target can call a bare address
 * from Python at all. The route is therefore real for androidNative -- whose CPython does ship
 * `_ctypes` -- and unavailable on iOS in both directions at once.
 *
 * So the Python-facing route here is a real `PyMethodDef`: [bind] hands back an ordinary built-in
 * function object whose `ml_meth` is a [staticCFunction] over [pmInvokeMethod] and whose `self`
 * is the callable handle. That is not a workaround so much as the thing `ctypes` was standing in
 * for on desktop -- desktop's ctypes shim in `UpcallEntryTest` (`commonTest`) exists precisely
 * because a `PyCFunction` slot is what a finished binder installs, and this skips the stand-in.
 *
 * The `@CName` symbols stay: they are what a C host embeds against, they are what `ctypes`
 * reaches on Android, and [invokeAddress] makes them callable regardless of what the linker did
 * with the name.
 *
 * ### Lifetime
 *
 * The `PyMethodDef`s and their names are allocated on [nativeHeap] and never freed: a
 * `PyCFunction` object stores the `PyMethodDef *` it was built from rather than copying it, so
 * freeing one would leave every callable built from it pointing at released memory. Five structs
 * for the life of the process.
