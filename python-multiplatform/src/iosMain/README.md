# iosMain — rules

iOS-specific sources. Depends on `nativeMain`; CPython arrives as `Python.xcframework`.

## The framework ships no standard library

`Python.xcframework` contains the interpreter binary and headers and nothing else.
`Py_Initialize()` needs `PYTHONHOME` to point at the stdlib on disk, and there are two different
ways it fails to if that's wrong — which one you get depends on *what's running*, not just on what
`PYTHONHOME` says, and only one of them is easy to diagnose.

**A missing or empty prefix aborts.** `Py_Initialize()` calls `Py_FatalError()` and kills the
process with `Fatal Python error: Failed to import encodings module` on stderr. No Kotlin
exception, no interpreter left afterward, but at least it is fast and it says what happened.
`Python3.initialize()` runs a pre-flight check before `Py_Initialize()` is ever reached (see
`python.multiplatform.env.PythonHomeCheck`) that catches this shape of misconfiguration and turns
it into a catchable `IllegalStateException` naming the path instead.

**A `PYTHONHOME` under a sandboxed path can hang instead — with 0% CPU and nothing in the
console.** Reproduced directly (ROADMAP, 2026-08-13, "PYTHONHOME on an external volume hangs the
app instead of failing it"): the *installed simulator app* parked forever inside `open$NOCANCEL`
importing `encodings` from a path under `/Volumes/` — a blank window, no sandbox denial, no Python
error anywhere in the log. `PythonHomeCheck`'s own filesystem probe cannot promise to catch this
either: it reads the same directory through the same kind of syscall CPython's import machinery
does, and a path whose access is *parked* rather than *denied* can park the check identically.

**The recipe below only works for the test binary, not the app — do not assume it carries over.**
The build extracts the stdlib from the BeeWare support archive into `build/python-stdlib/`, and
the simulator *test* task points `SIMCTL_CHILD_PYTHONHOME` at it directly (`simctl` only forwards
environment variables prefixed `SIMCTL_CHILD_`, which is what makes the test binary see it at
all). That path is still under this repo's workspace, which lives on an external volume (see
CLAUDE.md) — fine for the test binary, which `simctl` launches with fewer sandbox restrictions
than an *installed app*, but exactly the shape that hangs an app rather than starting it. An app
needs its stdlib staged **inside its own bundle or installed container**, with `PYTHONHOME`
pointed at that installed path, not at the workspace — see the reproduction recipe in ROADMAP for
the two extra steps (`rsync`ing the stdlib into the built `.app` and resolving
`SIMCTL_CHILD_PYTHONHOME` from `simctl get_app_container` after install) this repository does not
yet automate.

## The consumer's payload is staged and not attached — the runtime half is here, the Xcode half is not

`PythonPayload.discoverStagedPayloadRoots` looks for `python/` under
`NSBundle.mainBundle.resourcePath` and puts it on `sys.path` if it is there. Nothing puts it there.

`toolchain`'s `49da1d8` produces `build/pythonStaging/ios/python` and stops, saying why: "a native
framework has no Gradle resource mechanism, and its resources go through an Xcode phase in a project
file this plugin does not own." So three things are missing, all of them packaging:

1. A **Copy Bundle Resources** phase referencing that directory, with *folder reference* semantics —
   a group flattens the package directories and every `__init__.py` collides.
2. A **build-order dependency** on the Gradle task that produces it, expressed in the Run Script
   phase `iosApp/` already uses to drive Gradle.
3. A **run on device or simulator that proves it**, which is not desktop's check. Per the section
   above, a path under this repo's external volume does not merely fail for an *installed* app — it
   parks `open$NOCANCEL` forever at 0% CPU. Reading the payload out of the app's own bundle is what
   avoids that, and is why the answer must be the bundle rather than a workspace path.

Until (1) and (2) exist this returns an empty list on every run, and no test here can tell "the
phase is missing" from "the code is wrong". Desktop is the platform driven end to end instead.

## No boundary, in either direction

Python and Kotlin share one binary. Downcalls are direct cinterop calls, and an upcall from
Python into Kotlin is a plain function call. The composition and calling-convention work that
shapes the Android and desktop designs has no counterpart here.
