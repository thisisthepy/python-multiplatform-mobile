/**
 * The linear-memory side of the boundary. `Panama` is desktop's equivalent; this is smaller because
 * there is no boundary to cross for data.
 *
 * Kotlin's `intrinsics.memory` import is pointed at Emscripten's `Module.wasmMemory`, so CPython's
 * heap and Kotlin's linear memory are one `WebAssembly.Memory`. A `char*` CPython hands back is an
 * address `Pointer(addr)` reads directly -- no copy, no JS frame, and it keeps working after the
 * memory grows (a JS `TypedArray` view would detach; a wasm memory import does not).
 *
 * ### The rule that shapes every function here
 *
 * **`withScopedMemoryAllocator` must never be called on this target.** It is the only allocator
 * Kotlin/Wasm offers and it allocates from address 0 upward -- measured handing back `0x0` after
 * growing the memory by two pages -- which on a shared memory is directly on top of Emscripten's
 * static data. So CPython allocates and Kotlin only dereferences. [allocUtf8] goes through
 * CPython's own `malloc` for that reason.
 *
 * See docs/wasm-design.md and `wasm-experiment/README.md` for the measurements.

    // which is a `malloc`, an encode, a copy and a `free` per invocation. Measured against the real
    // interpreter that put `PyObject_GetAttrString` at 377 ns while a bare crossing
    // (`Py_IncRef`/`Py_DecRef`) was 44 ns.
    //
    // The judgement is per *argument*, not per function, and it is the same one desktop and Android
    // make (`ShapeDowncalls.desktop.kt`, `ShapeDowncalls.android.kt`):
    //
    //     internedUtf8   a repeated identifier -- attribute, method, module, type, dict key
    //     scratchUtf8    arbitrary content -- source text, messages, docs, paths, user data
    //
    // What is *different* here is why each is cheap, and it is worth writing down because the
    // obvious reading of "shared memory" is wrong. Kotlin/Wasm compiles with
    // `builtins: ['js-string']`, so a Kotlin `String` is a JS string and reading it is not free --
    // the encode is real work, not a copy that shared memory makes disappear. What shared memory
    // removes is the *other* half: the destination is CPython's own heap, so there is no staging
    // buffer and no crossing. So:
    //
    //   * interning removes the encode, the malloc and the free -- everything but a hash lookup;
    //   * scratch removes the malloc and the free but keeps the encode, which is why it is the
    //     fallback rather than the default.
    //
    // Both write straight into linear memory instead of going through `encodeToByteArray()`, which
    // would allocate a WasmGC `ByteArray` per call and then copy it byte by byte.
