/**
 * The wasmJs half of the upcall boundary: [invokeMethod] is what CPython calls, reached the way
 * `docs/upcall-design.md` names for this target and ROADMAP §11 already measured --
 * `@WasmExport` plus `Table.set`, 3.1 ns/call through `call_indirect`. Everything past `self`/`args`
 * is [UpcallTrampoline], which is `commonMain` and knows nothing about wasm.
 *
 * `@WasmExport` is honoured only in the compilation that produces the `.wasm`, so the export
 * itself cannot live here -- the identical constraint `ProxyTypeFactory.kt` records for its three
 * type slots. `wasmJsTest/.../UpcallExports.kt` is the three-line file an application embedding
 * this library has to write; this object holds everything that could ever need changing.
 *
 * ### One export is enough for the whole bootstrap
 *
 * This used to publish nothing into Python at all: only a *bound* callable crossed, and
 * `docs/upcall-async-design.md` §12.4 recorded that `_pm_resolve`/`_pm_invoke`/`_pm_release`/
 * `_pm_cancel` would each need a **new `@WasmExport`**, which -- being honoured only in the
 * application's own compilation -- the library could never add. The consequence was that
 * `PythonProxySource.install()` refused on this target and no generated proxy existed here.
 *
 * That reasoning had a hole in it, and it is in the shape of a `PyCFunction`. `ml_meth` is a
 * function *pointer*, but a `PyCFunction` object also carries a `self`, and `PyCFunction_NewEx`
 * builds a fresh one per call. So **one** exported function pointer already backs arbitrarily many
 * distinct Python callables, told apart by what is boxed in `self` -- which is exactly what [bind]
 * has always done with a [CallableHandle]. Reserving a handful of values `self` can never
 * legitimately hold turns the same pointer into a dispatcher: [OP_RESOLVE] and its four siblings
 * are negative, and a real handle never is ([CallableHandle.isValid] is `raw >= 0`, and
 * [CallableHandle.NONE] is the single other negative value, `-1`, which is deliberately *not* an
 * op and still reaches the trampoline's own rejection).
 *
 * There is therefore no op *argument*: `self` is the discriminator that was already there. The
 * five entry points [publish] installs are five `PyCFunction` objects over one `PyMethodDef` shape
 * and one `Table.set`, and an embedding application still writes the same three lines it did
 * before.
 *
 * **What this does not buy** is the async half. `import asyncio` traps this wasm instance rather
 * than raising (`AsyncUpcallPortabilityTest`, `docs/upcall-async-design.md` §9.5), so a proxy whose
 * Kotlin body genuinely suspends still cannot be awaited here. The synchronous surface --
 * constructors, methods, properties, statics -- is what became reachable.
 *
 * ### A note on the GIL, for callers reading this rather than `nativeMain`'s equivalent
 *
 * [invokeMethod] is reached *from* C (`call_indirect`, with CPython already holding the GIL the
 * way any `PyCFunction` call does), so [handleOf] takes its own unconditional
 * `PyGILState_Ensure`/`Release` pair rather than trusting `withGIL`'s nesting depth -- the same
 * rule `UpcallTrampoline`'s own `attached` documents. [bind], in contrast, is called *from*
 * Kotlin, so it uses the ordinary [python.multiplatform.ffi.withGIL]. Both are safe to call
 * repeatedly on their own; what is not safe, and cost an afternoon to isolate, is a bare C API
 * call made directly by a *caller* after either one returns -- `PyGILState_Release` genuinely
 * detaches the thread here once the nesting count reaches zero, unlike a build where the main
 * thread stays implicitly attached forever. Every raw call after [bind] returns must go through
 * `withGIL` too; `UpcallEntryTest` is written that way for exactly this reason.
