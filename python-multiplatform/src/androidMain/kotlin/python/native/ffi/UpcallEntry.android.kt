/**
 * What the C entry points in `artMain/cinterop/jni_onload.def` call on every upcall.
 *
 * ### Why the boundary runs this way round
 *
 * Desktop turns a Kotlin method into a C function pointer with a Panama upcall stub, and
 * Kotlin/Native does the same with `staticCFunction`. Android has neither: `androidMain` is
 * Kotlin/JVM and the JVM it runs on is ART, which has no Panama. A `PyMethodDef`'s `ml_meth` has
 * to be a real C function pointer, so the entry points are C functions in `jni_onload.def` and
 * *they* call *this*, through `CallStaticLongMethod` against a class registered in `JNI_OnLoad`.
 *
 * That is the same inversion [python.multiplatform.ffi.ProxyCallbacks] already makes for
 * `tp_traverse`/`tp_clear`, and this file is deliberately its twin: same registration mechanism,
 * same `pmp_attach` on the C side, same rule that nothing may be thrown back into C.
 *
 * ### What is *not* here
 *
 * None of the marshalling. Turning a Python argument tuple into an `Array<Any?>` and a Kotlin
 * result back into a `PyObject *` is [UpcallTrampoline], which is `commonMain` and shared with
 * every other platform -- `docs/upcall-design.md`'s "what each platform still owes" is only the
 * address-publishing step, and on Android that step is the C shim plus these three methods.
 *
 * ### Rules these must obey
 *
 * - **Nothing may be thrown.** The caller is C reached from CPython. A Kotlin exception left
 *   pending across a JNI return aborts the ART runtime outright, so each of these is total: a
 *   failure leaves as `0` / `CallableHandle.NONE` / `0`, and the C side turns that into a Python
 *   error indicator. [UpcallTrampoline.invoke] already catches everything; the guards here are for
 *   the call itself, including a `<clinit>` that fails.
 * - **The GIL is taken by [UpcallTrampoline], not here.** CPython holds it when it calls a
 *   `PyCFunction`, but the trampoline still takes its own `PyGILState_Ensure`/`Release` pair
 *   unconditionally -- `commonMain/README.md`'s rule for any entry point reached from C, since the
 *   nesting-depth counter records only scopes Kotlin opened. `PyGILState_Ensure` is reentrant, so
 *   the second one costs a counter bump.
 * - **Reference conventions belong to the trampoline too.** Arguments arrive borrowed and the
 *   result leaves as a new reference; nothing on this file's path touches a refcount.
 *
 * ### What this still costs
 *
 * Measured by `UpcallOverheadTest` on `pmp_api26` / `pmp_api36`, two runs each, per upcall:
 *
 * | | API 26 | API 36 |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | steady state, any thread | 1209–1329 ns | 2301–3086 ns |
 * | **first upcall on a Python worker thread** | **139625–141958 ns** | **55917–125083 ns** |
 * | the same call shape as a downcall, for scale | 1213–1217 ns | 980–1541 ns |
 *
 * The first row is the JNI upcall and the trampoline's marshalling, and it is now within ~1-2x of
 * a downcall of the same shape. The second is the one cost that could not be removed: a
 * `threading.Thread` is a bare pthread, so the first time one reaches ART it must be attached.
 * `pmp_attach` holds that attachment for the life of the thread and gives it back from a
 * `pthread_key_create` destructor, which is what turned it from a per-call charge of 14–62 µs into
 * a per-thread one — but a thread that upcalls exactly once still pays all of it.
 *
 * It is not marked with [HighOverheadNativeCall]. That marker is `@RequiresOptIn`, and its job is
 * to make a Kotlin *caller* acknowledge a cost; nothing in Kotlin calls these — C does, from
 * CPython — so applying it here would be inert. The cost is recorded instead where the callers
 * that can act on it will look: here, in `pmp_upcall_invoke_meth`, and in `docs/upcall-design.md`.
