/**
 * The Kotlin half of the proxy type's `tp_traverse`, `tp_clear` and `tp_dealloc`.
 *
 * ### Why this shape and not the desktop one
 *
 * Desktop turns two Kotlin functions into C function pointers with Panama upcall stubs, and
 * Kotlin/Native does the same with `staticCFunction`. Android has neither: `androidMain` is
 * Kotlin/JVM, and the JVM it runs on is ART, which has no Panama. So the two slots are C
 * functions in `artMain/cinterop/jni_onload.def`, and *they* call *this* -- the direction of the
 * boundary is inverted relative to every other platform.
 *
 * That inversion is why [traverse] returns an array instead of taking a visitor. `visit` is a
 * bare C function pointer; there is no way to call one from Kotlin/JVM without a downcall
 * mechanism Android does not have. So the C side keeps the visiting and asks only which
 * pointers to visit.
 *
 * ### Rules these two must obey
 *
 * CPython holds the GIL when it calls the slots, so neither of these may take it ([withGIL]) or
 * release it. Neither may call back into the C API at all: `tp_clear` in particular must not
 * touch reference counts, because the collector is in the middle of accounting for them and a
 * `Py_DecRef` from here double-frees. Releasing the [HandleTable] entry is the whole job --
 * that entry is the Kotlin-side half of the cycle, and dropping it is what breaks the loop.
 *
 * Both swallow exceptions. A `Throwable` crossing back into a running collection has nowhere to
 * go: the C side clears the pending exception because `RegisterNatives`-bound code cannot leave
 * one set, and the only channel back into CPython is a return value that aborts the traversal
 * rather than reporting anything.
 *
 * ### Overhead
 *
 * One JNI upcall per traversed proxy per collection, plus one `LongArray` allocation, plus the
 * boxing `ReflectedClass.traverse`'s `(Long) -> Unit` visitor forces on the JVM. Desktop pays
 * the boxing too; the upcall and the array are Android's alone. Nothing here is on a hot path
 * until an application holds many proxies at once, but a collection sweeping N proxies costs N
 * JVM allocations inside CPython's collector, which is where to look first if a GC pause on
 * Android turns out worse than on desktop.

     * what an unregistered class produces. That silence is by design and is worth knowing
     * about: it reads exactly like "the object was never GC-tracked". If a cycle is not
     * collected, check that [ClassLookup] has the class before suspecting the slots -- a test
     * that registers its class only on the path where it also initialises the interpreter
     * registers nothing in a full-suite run, and both desktop and iOS hit that once.

/**
 * Android's cycle-collecting proxy type.
 *
 * The type itself is built in C (`proxy_create_type` in `jni_onload.def`) because its three slots
 * have to be C function pointers. This is the Kotlin entry point to that, plus the accessors a
 * caller needs to put a handle into a proxy instance.
 *
 * ### The foreign-thread path is exercised now
 *
 * The slots used to be reached only from a thread that already runs Kotlin -- the one that called
 * `gc.collect()` -- so `pmp_attach`'s `GetEnv` always succeeded and the
 * `AttachCurrentThreadAsDaemon` branch beside it was, as far as any test went, dead code.
 *
 * `CycleCollectionTest.testCycleCollectedOnAThreadCPythonCreated` and
 * `testDeallocOnAThreadCPythonCreated` close that. A `threading.Thread` is a bare pthread ART has
 * never seen, and those two run the collection, and the last-reference drop, on one. Neither
 * infers the thread from the effect: the `traverse` lambda they register records
 * `Thread.currentThread().id`, and they assert it differs from the instrumentation thread's -- so
 * a callback that had quietly been re-dispatched onto a thread ART already knew would fail rather
 * than pass. Green on `pmp_api26` and `pmp_api36`, 216 tests each, 0 failed, with no
 * `Native thread exiting without having called DetachCurrentThread` in either logcat. That line
 * is what ART prints immediately before aborting if the detach on the way out is ever missed, so
 * its absence is the attach/detach balance being checked rather than assumed.
 *
 * `tp_dealloc` (`pmp_proxy_dealloc` in `jni_onload.def`) closes what used to be the larger hole:
 * a proxy that dies without a cycle never runs `tp_clear`, so its [HandleTable] entry leaked --
 * and since cycles are the exception, almost every proxy died that way. All three platforms
 * carry the slot, and all three now measure it:
 * `CycleCollectionTest.testHandleReleasedWhenProxyDiesWithoutCycle` drops 100 cycle-free proxies
 * and checks both the handles and the type's own `ob_refcnt` (through [bindings.obRefCnt] here,
 * `sun.misc.Unsafe` on desktop, a `LongVar` load on Kotlin/Native).
