/**
 * The contract [PythonBootstrap] has to hold up, written before it existed.
 *
 * Three copies of this bootstrap were hand-written before the helper: `sample`'s `MainActivity`,
 * the external consumer app used to verify §15d, and `PythonOnDevice` in this very source set.
 * They disagreed on the one thing that matters -- how to tell "already unpacked" from "half
 * unpacked" -- so the tests below fix that decision rather than the copying, which all three got
 * right.
 *
 * Everything here stages into a scratch prefix under `cacheDir`, never `filesDir`: the live
 * interpreter this instrumentation process is already running reads its stdlib out of `filesDir`,
 * and a test that re-unpacked over it would be pulling the floor out from under the other 340-odd
 * tests in the same process.
