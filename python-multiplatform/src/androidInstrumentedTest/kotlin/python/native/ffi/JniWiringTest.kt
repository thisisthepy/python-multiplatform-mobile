/**
 * Settles, on a real device, whether the JNI wiring between the Kotlin/Native `@CName` exports and
 * the `external fun` declarations in [bindings] actually passes arguments correctly.
 *
 * The exports take only their declared arguments — none of them accepts a `JNIEnv*`. But `bindings`
 * declares them as ordinary JNI methods, and ART invokes those as
 * `f(JNIEnv*, jobject, args...)`. If that is what happens, every argument arrives shifted by two
 * slots and the first one reads the `JNIEnv` pointer instead of its value.
 *
 * Zero-argument functions survive this by accident, since the callee simply ignores the extra
 * registers. So the check has to pass a value and read it back: [bindings.diagEcho] returns its
 * argument unchanged, which makes the shift immediately visible.
