/**
 * What an Android upcall actually costs, and whether the attach it needs is paid once per thread
 * or once per call.
 *
 * The commit that landed the Android boundary named two costs and measured neither:
 *
 *  1. one JNI upcall per call, and
 *  2. an `AttachCurrentThreadAsDaemon`/`DetachCurrentThread` pair whenever Python calls from a
 *     thread ART has never seen -- which every `threading.Thread` is, because CPython creates
 *     bare pthreads.
 *
 * The second is the one that decides whether anything needs changing, and it cannot be settled by
 * reading `jni_onload.def`'s `pmp_attach` alone: that function only says *an* attach happens when
 * `GetEnv` fails. Whether the attachment survives to the next call is a property of the caller
 * *and* of ART, so it is observed here rather than argued.
 *
 * ### What it cost when it was per call, and what changed
 *
 * The first run of this test found the attach was paid on **every** call, and priced it:
 *
 * | | API 26 | API 36 |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | upcall, instrumentation thread | 1695 ns | 6693 ns |
 * | upcall, Python worker | 63293 ns | 31219 ns |
 * | attach, i.e. the difference | **61598 ns** | **24526 ns** |
 *
 * `pmp_attach` now keeps the attachment for the life of the thread and releases it from a
 * `pthread_key_create` destructor, so the worker figure should collapse onto the instrumentation
 * one. `UpcallThreadAttachTest` holds the correctness half of that change; this holds the price.
 *
 * ### How the attach is counted rather than inferred from a stopwatch
 *
 * `AttachCurrentThreadAsDaemon` builds a fresh `java.lang.Thread` for the pthread it attaches, and
 * `Thread.getId()` comes from a monotonic counter that is never reused. So the identity of the
 * thread the *Kotlin* side lands on is a direct readout of the attach: N calls from one Python
 * worker report N distinct ids if the attach is per call, and one id if it is per thread. That is
 * `probe.whichThread` -- the same fragment `UpcallEntryTest` uses to prove the attach branch is
 * taken at all -- read back as a Python `set`.
 *
 * A timing-only answer would have been ambiguous on an emulator; this one is not.
 *
 * ### Why everything is in one test method
 *
 * The downcall figures are here rather than borrowed from `overhead/BenchmarkTest`, because a
 * ratio between two *different runs* on an emulator is not a measurement. `commonMain/README.md`'s
 * companion rule applies to warmup too: an unwarmed first row once made a subset of the work look
 * cheaper than the whole of it in this repo, so every loop below is preceded by a warmup of the
 * same shape, and the Python-side loop overhead is measured and reported alongside so the boundary
 * cost can be read net of it.
 *
 * Results are printed rather than asserted on. A wall-clock threshold on an emulator would be a
 * flake generator; what *is* asserted is the structural fact (how many attaches N calls cost),
 * which is deterministic.

         * Same shape as the measured loop, run first.
         *
         * ### Why 100 000 and not the 3 000 this used to be
         *
         * At 3 000 this test reported a same-process warm-up state rather than a boundary cost.
         * The evidence is in this file's own history: the API 36 upcall row read `2982-5086` ns
         * and later `1032-1229` ns with **the same warmup and the same emulator** -- the only
         * thing that differed was how many tests ran before it. A number that moves by 4x on what
         * ran first is not measuring the boundary.
         *
         * `UpcallBoundaryCostTest` diagnosed the mechanism and `7e9c6b8c` fixed it there: it is
         * host JIT tier-up, not CPython-side state. The discriminator is that the rows with no
         * boundary in them -- the empty Python loop and the pure-Python callee -- are flat from
         * the first repetition, while only the rows crossing into host code move. On ART that
         * host is a JIT too, so the same fix applies here.
         *
         * ART is the tightest of the hosts swept in `ec53b6e5`: API 36 only reached its plateau
         * at roughly 90 000-100 000 calls, where desktop needed ~70 000 and wasm ~70 000. So
         * 100 000 is ART's requirement with little margin to spare, and that is why this constant
         * is 100 000 rather than something smaller that would do elsewhere.
         *
         * The cost is bounded by what it warms: three warmup loops of 100 000 calls, at the
         * ~1 us per call this test reports for the dearest of them, is a fraction of a second.
         *
         * This deliberately does **not** warm the worker thread's upcall path -- see
         * `_pm_worker_body`, whose first upcall is a measurement (`upcall_worker_first`), not
         * waste. The worker still benefits from this warmup, because JIT tier-up is a property of
         * the process rather than of the thread, which is what leaves the per-thread attach as
         * the only thing that row still has to pay.
