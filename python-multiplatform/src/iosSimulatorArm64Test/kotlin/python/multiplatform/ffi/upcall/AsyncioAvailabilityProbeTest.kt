/**
 * `docs/upcall-async-design.md` §10.6: whether `asyncio` exists on the iOS distribution has never
 * been measured, only assumed absent by analogy with `_ctypes` (`docs/upcall-design.md` §"Can
 * Python call an address at all?"). That analogy does not hold on inspection -- the BeeWare
 * archive `extractIosSimulatorStdlib` unpacks *does* carry `lib-dynload/_asyncio*.so`,
 * `lib-dynload/_socket*.so` and `lib-dynload/select*.so`, unlike this project's `Python.xcframework`
 * itself, which ships no `lib-dynload` at all. Those are two different things: the xcframework
 * binary the app links against, and the separately-unpacked stdlib prefix `PYTHONHOME` points at.
 *
 * This is deliberately its own file and its own tiny probe rather than folded into a bigger test,
 * so a trap here (the wasmJs shape `AsyncUpcallPortabilityTest` documents: `import asyncio`
 * killing the whole process rather than raising) is isolated to one file and easy to bisect.
 *
 * Lives in `iosSimulatorArm64Test` specifically, not `nativeTest`, so it never reaches
 * androidNative or a real iOS device -- neither has been asked for here, and `nativeTest` would
 * put it on both without evidence either needs it.
