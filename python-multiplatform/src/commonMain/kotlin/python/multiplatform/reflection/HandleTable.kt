/**
 * The GC root that lets Python hold a Kotlin object.
 *
 * `docs/object-lifetime.md` sketches the whole thing in four lines:
 *
 *     private val liveHandles = HashMap<Long, Any>()
 *     fun register(obj: Any): Long { val h = next++; liveHandles[h] = obj; return h }
 *     fun release(h: Long)        { liveHandles.remove(h) }
 *
 * This is that, with the two properties the sketch leaves out.
 *
 * **Slot reuse.** Storage is an array indexed by the low half of the handle, so resolution is a
 * bounds check and an array read rather than a hash. A release returns the slot to a free list,
 * which keeps the array bounded by the number of *live* handles instead of the number ever
 * issued.
 *
 * **Staleness.** Reusing a slot without changing the handle would alias a released handle onto
 * the next object to occupy it: Python would keep calling, every call would land on the wrong
 * instance, and nothing anywhere would report an error. So each slot carries a generation that
 * is bumped on release, and resolution rejects a handle whose generation no longer matches.
 *
 * **This table leaks by construction.** Every entry is a strong reference the Kotlin GC can
 * see and Python cannot; nothing here can tell that the Python proxy has died. The proxy's
 * `tp_dealloc` calling [release] is the entire lifetime contract, and it is why [release]
 * reports whether it actually did anything -- a double release must not free a slot that has
 * since been handed to someone else.
 *
 * That contract is kept in exactly two places, and a handle that reaches Python by any other
 * route is a leak:
 *
 * - a **proxy instance**, through the `__del__` `python.multiplatform.ffi.upcall.PythonProxySource`
 *   renders beside every `__init__` that takes a handle. It went unwritten for as long as the
 *   generator existed, and `GeneratedProxyCostTest` ended a run with 78 002 live entries because
 *   of it; `ProxyHandleLifetimeTest` now pins both ends of the count.
 * - a **bare handle** handed to a caller that asked for one over the raw boundary, through
 *   `_pm_release`. Nothing else can give that one back: it is an integer, and an integer has
 *   nothing to hang a finaliser off.
 *
 * Cycles are a separate problem this table cannot solve on its own: a strong entry here is a
 * root, so a Python object reachable only through a Kotlin object reachable only from this
 * table never collects. That needs `tp_traverse` to reach through the handle
 * ([ReflectedClass.traverse]), and for the Kotlin-side case it needs this table to hold weakly
 * with the proxy supplying the strength -- which `docs/object-lifetime.md` records as not yet
 * worked through.
 *
 * ### Threading
 *
 * Not synchronised. Every mutation happens on a thread that holds the GIL: an upcall arrives
 * with it held, and handing a Kotlin object to Python requires it to build the proxy. That is
 * the same rule the rest of the boundary already lives under (`commonMain/README.md`), and it
 * is what makes the plain `ArrayList`s here safe. It stops being true under free-threading
 * (ROADMAP §9), where this needs a real lock.
