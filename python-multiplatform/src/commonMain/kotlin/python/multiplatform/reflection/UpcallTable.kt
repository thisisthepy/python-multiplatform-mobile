 * The runtime half of the build-time function table (ROADMAP §7, `docs/upcall-design.md`).
 *
 * A name is resolved to a [CallableHandle] once; every call after that carries only the handle --
 * a table index plus an epoch that rejects handles from a table that has since been reinstalled.
 * `docs/upcall-design.md` takes this from ObjC: the win is not having a table, it is never
 * hashing and comparing a string more than once per name.
 *
 * [ClassLookup] is the companion registry for the [ReflectedClass] half of a fragment; it is
 * cleared and populated in lockstep with this table rather than merged into it, because class
 * lookup (`type()`, `isinstance()`) is a distinct Python-visible operation from callable
 * resolution even though both come from the same fragments.
 *
 * ### Threading
 * Not synchronised, for the same reason as [HandleTable]: installation happens once at start-up,
 * or under the GIL for an upcall-driven [register], never concurrently with a lookup.
