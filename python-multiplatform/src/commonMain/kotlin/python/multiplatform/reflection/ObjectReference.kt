/**
 * A Python-side reference to a Kotlin object: an integer, and nothing else.
 *
 * Python cannot hold the object itself on any of our targets -- a JVM reference stored in
 * native memory is invisible to the GC, a Kotlin/Native reference is a raw pointer with no
 * ownership, and a WasmGC reference cannot be written into linear memory at all. So the proxy's
 * instance data holds this integer and [HandleTable] holds the object. `docs/object-lifetime.md`
 * calls this "what JNI's `NewGlobalRef` does, made explicit".
 *
 * The raw value packs a **generation** into the high 32 bits and a **slot index** into the low
 * 32. Slots are reused; generations are not, so a handle that outlived its release does not
 * resolve to whatever took its slot. Without that, a stale handle would silently call methods
 * on the wrong instance -- the one boundary bug that produces no error at all.
 *
 * Generations start at 1, so a valid handle is never `0`. Zero is [NONE], which is what the
 * boundary uses for "no object".
