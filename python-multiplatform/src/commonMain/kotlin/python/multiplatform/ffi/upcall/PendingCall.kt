/**
 * One Kotlin coroutine started from a frame that had to return without it, and the place its
 * outcome waits until something asks for it.
 *
 * This is the half of `docs/upcall-async-design.md` that all three candidate conventions share.
 * The problem the doc states is structural: CPython calls a C function pointer, that C frame has
 * to hand back a `PyObject *` before it returns, and a suspension has nothing to hand back.
 * `runBlocking` "solves" it by re-seizing the very thread that would have been freed -- on Android
 * that thread is one CPython created, so blocking it stops the interpreter that is waiting on the
 * answer. What is left is to return *something else* and deliver the value later, and every way of
 * doing that begins here.
 *
 * ### What this deliberately does not do
 *
 * It does not deliver anything to Python. [onCompleted] is the single seam a delivery convention
 * attaches to, and [AsyncUpcall] is the one that does -- it resolves an `asyncio.Future` from the
 * completing thread. Keeping that out of here is not indecision: this half is pure Kotlin, so it
 * is identical on all five targets and testable with no interpreter at all (`PendingCallTest` is
 * in `commonTest` for that reason), while the delivery half is entirely C API calls.
 *
 * ### No `kotlinx.coroutines`
 *
 * `startCoroutine` and [Continuation] are `kotlin-stdlib`, common source set, every target. The
 * library has no coroutines dependency and must not grow one for this: the `suspend fun` being
 * exposed is the *user's*, and whatever dispatcher it uses is already on their classpath. Starting
 * it takes nothing more than the stdlib.
 *
 * ### No dispatcher, and the fast path that falls out of it
 *
 * The coroutine's context is this object and nothing else -- no dispatcher, no [Continuation]
 * interceptor of any kind (see [cancel] for why the context is not simply empty). So the body runs
 * on the calling thread until it actually suspends. So a
 * `suspend fun` that never reaches a real suspension point -- which is most of them, most of the
 * time -- is **already complete when [start] returns**, and the boundary can hand Python the real
 * value with no async convention involved at all. `PendingCallTest` pins that.
 *
 * The converse is the cost: the body's first slice runs inside the C frame, holding the GIL, so an
 * exposed `suspend fun` that does its blocking work *before* its first suspension point blocks the
 * interpreter exactly as a non-suspending one would. `suspend` is a signature, not a promise.
 *
 * ### Threading
 *
 * Not synchronised, and it does not need to be **provided the rule the rest of the boundary
 * already lives under is kept**: every mutation happens on a thread holding the GIL
 * (`commonMain/README.md`, and [python.multiplatform.reflection.HandleTable]'s own threading
 * note). That is not an extra burden here -- a completion that wants to reach Python has to take
 * the GIL to do anything at all, so the scope it needs for that already covers this. What is *not*
 * safe is resuming an exposed call's continuation without one and expecting the fields below to be
 * visible to the next upcall; the GIL is the barrier.
 *
 * Nothing here allocates a handle. A `PendingCall` is an ordinary Kotlin object, so
 * [python.multiplatform.reflection.HandleTable] already gives it a generational handle and
 * [UpcallTrampoline.releaseObject] already gives Python the way to drop it.

     *
     * ### What this is not
     *
     * **It does not stop the coroutine.** It cannot, and the reason is structural rather than a
     * missing feature. [start] hands its own [Continuation] to `startCoroutine` as the coroutine's
     * *completion*, which is resumed exactly once, when the whole body is finished. The
     * continuation that represents the body's current suspension point is a different object
     * entirely, and it belongs to whoever created the suspension -- the user's
     * `suspendCoroutine`, or their dispatcher, or `kotlinx.coroutines` machinery this library has
     * no dependency on. Nothing here ever sees it, and the stdlib offers no way to reach it.
     *
     * Resuming a continuation twice is undefined, so there is no back door either. Forcible
     * cancellation is what a `Job` tree is *for*, and building one is `kotlinx.coroutines`'
     * job; `docs/upcall-async-design.md` §6 states the no-dependency rule this obeys.
     *
     * ### What it is
     *
     * A cancellation flag published where a *cooperating* body can read it. Because the coroutine
     * runs with this object as its [CoroutineContext], the body reaches it as
     * `coroutineContext[PendingCall]`, and [ensureActive] is the one-line form:
     *
     *     suspend fun slowSum(n: Long): Long {
     *         var total = 0L
     *         for (i in 0 until n) { ensureActive(); total += step(i) }
     *         return total
     *     }
     *
     * That is the same bargain `kotlinx.coroutines` makes -- cancellation is cooperative there too,
     * and a body that never suspends and never checks is uncancellable there as well. The
     * difference is only that `kotlinx.coroutines`' own suspending functions do the checking for
     * you, and there are none here.
     *
     * A body that does not cooperate keeps running to completion, and its outcome is simply
     * dropped: [AsyncUpcall] refuses to deliver a result to a `Future` that is already settled.
     * That is the guarantee this half is actually responsible for.
     *
     * @return `true` if this call was live and is now cancelled; `false` if it had already
     *   completed (there was nothing left to stop) or was already cancelled.
