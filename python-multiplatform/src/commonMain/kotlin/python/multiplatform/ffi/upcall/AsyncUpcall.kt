/**
 * The delivery half of `docs/upcall-async-design.md`: how the outcome of a Kotlin coroutine that
 * could not finish inside the C frame reaches the Python code waiting for it.
 *
 * [PendingCall] is the half that starts the coroutine and parks its outcome; this is the half that
 * attaches to its `onCompleted` seam. The design doc picks candidate **(C)** -- `asyncio` -- as the
 * surface, implemented by candidate **(B)** -- a downcall from the completing thread -- because
 * `loop.call_soon_threadsafe` *is* a downcall. Nothing here needs a binding that was not already in
 * `EmbedAPI`; `AsyncCompletionProbeTest` measured that before any of this was written.
 *
 * ### Two returns, and the fast one is the common one
 *
 * `suspend` is a signature, not a promise to suspend. A body that never reaches a suspension point
 * is already complete when `PendingCall.start` returns (measured:
 * `PendingCallTest.aBlockThatNeverSuspendsIsAlreadyCompleteBeforeStartReturns`), and that call gets
 * the real value marshalled through the ordinary path -- **no `Future`, no event loop, no
 * `asyncio` import**. Only a call that actually suspended pays for one.
 *
 * The cost of that choice is that the boundary returns two different Python types for one Kotlin
 * declaration, so the Python-side proxy has to be an `async def` that awaits its result only when
 * the result is awaitable. [PythonProxySource] generates exactly that.
 *
 * ### Cancellation
 *
 * `Future.cancel()` settles the `Future` immediately, so a completion can arrive for a call nobody
 * is waiting for any more. Delivering it would raise `InvalidStateError` inside a loop callback;
 * [resolve] documents what that was measured to cost and what is done about it. The Kotlin side of
 * cancellation -- what [PendingCall.cancel] can and cannot do -- is on [PendingCall].
 *
 * It used to tell the Kotlin coroutine nothing at all until it finished. [armCancellationNotice] is
 * the other direction: the `Future` carries a handle on the [PendingCall], and its own done callback
 * hands the cancellation back over the same `(long) -> int` shape `_pm_release` uses. A body that
 * checks `ensureActive()` therefore stops at its next checkpoint rather than at the end. Where the
 * host has not bound `_pm_cancel`, nothing is armed and nothing is rooted, and the behaviour is the
 * one that existed before -- cancellation observed at completion by [resolve]'s `done()` check.
 *
 * ### What requires the application to be async
 *
 * The slow path needs a **running** loop on the calling thread, because the upcall arrives from
 * inside a coroutine and `asyncio.get_running_loop()` is what names the loop that coroutine is on.
 * With nothing running there is nowhere to deliver to, and this fails loudly rather than handing
 * back something that would never resolve. The coroutine has already been started by then -- it had
 * to be, since whether it suspends is only knowable after starting it -- so its eventual resumption
 * is stranded. That is a real cost of candidate (C) and it is not hidden.
 *
 * ### Reference conventions
 *
 * - The `Future` handed to Python is a **new reference**, like every other trampoline result: the
 *   Kotlin wrapper keeps the one `create_future` gave it and Python gets an increment of its own.
 * - The wrapper stays reachable because the completion lambda captures it, the lambda is held by
 *   the [PendingCall], and the [PendingCall] is held by whatever holds the suspended continuation.
 *   When the completion fires, [PendingCall] drops the listener and both wrappers become
 *   collectable, at which point their cleaners return the references.
 * - Nothing here holds a *borrowed* pointer across a GIL release.
 *
 * ### Threading
 *
 * The completion arrives on whatever thread resumed the coroutine, which is generally **not** the
 * thread that took the upcall, so it takes its own GIL scope before touching anything
 * (`commonMain/README.md`: "Every C API call needs the GIL"). [withGIL] is the right scope here
 * rather than [UpcallTrampoline]'s unconditional `PyGILState_Ensure`: this is not an entry point
 * from C, so the thread's nesting depth is its own honest record. A completer thread CPython has
 * never seen has depth 0 and takes a real `PyGILState_Ensure`; a completion delivered from inside a
 * later upcall runs under the depth that upcall's `attached` already set, and correctly skips.
 *
 * Nothing is thrown out of the completion. [PendingCall.deliver] catches into
 * [PendingCall.deliveryFailure], which matters because on the fast-completing path the listener can
 * run inside the C frame with nothing above it to unwind into.

     * Gives Python a way to tell [call] it has been abandoned, and returns the handle that costs.

     * `docs/upcall-async-design.md` §9.3 could only offer cancellation observed *at completion*,
     * because nothing carried the identity of a running [PendingCall] across to Python. This is the
     * thing it said was missing: a [HandleTable] handle rides on the `Future` -- captured by the
     * done callback `_pm_watch` attaches, not stored as an attribute, so nothing depends on whether
     * `asyncio.Future` tolerates having attributes set on it -- and `_pm_cancel` brings it back.
     *
     * ### Lifetime
     *
     * The handle is a GC root; [HandleTable] reclaims nothing on its own. Two things give it back,
     * and they are deliberately not the same thing:
     *
     * - **`_pm_watch`'s done callback**, on every way the `Future` can settle. This is the one that
     *   covers a body that never cooperates: the call is cancelled, the coroutine runs on forever,
     *   and Kotlin's completion path never gets a chance to release anything.
     * - **[resolve]**, when the coroutine finishes. This covers a `Future` whose loop stopped
     *   before it could run the callback, and it is what makes the common outcome self-sufficient.
     *
     * Either may run first and neither has to know about the other, because a handle table release
     * is generational: the second one finds a slot whose generation has moved on and does nothing,
     * even if the slot has since been reissued to someone else.
     *
     * What is still not reclaimed is a call whose `Future` is never settled *and* whose coroutine
     * never finishes. That call has leaked its continuation as well, and no handle scheme can be
     * the thing that notices.
     *
     * @return the handle to release at completion, or `null` when no notice was armed -- either
     *   because the host has not bound `_pm_cancel`/`_pm_release`, or because arming it failed.
     *   Nothing is rooted in that case.

     * from its own loop's thread, and this is the documented hand-off. It is also the only part of
     * candidate (C) that is not simply candidate (B) -- and it is itself a downcall, which is the
     * design doc's point.
     *
     * ### Delivering to a `Future` that has stopped waiting
     *
     * `Future.cancel()` is complete the instant Python calls it: the awaiting coroutine already has
     * its `CancelledError` and the `Future` is settled forever. The Kotlin coroutine knew nothing
     * about that and finished anyway, so its outcome arrives at a `Future` that will not take it,
     * and `set_result` on a settled `Future` raises `InvalidStateError`.
     *
     * **Measured, before this was guarded** (`AsyncUpcallCancellationTest`): the raise lands inside
     * the loop callback, where asyncio hands it to `call_exception_handler` -- one
     * `InvalidStateError: invalid state` reported against an application that did nothing wrong and
     * can do nothing about it, since the value being reported was abandoned deliberately. It did
     * *not* leak the error indicator and did *not* damage the next call; both were checked, because
     * this repository has twice been bitten by an indicator left set by one call and charged to
     * another. So the cost was noise, not corruption -- but noise nobody can act on.
     *
     * Two things are done about it, and the second is the one that actually holds. Scheduling is
     * skipped when the `Future` is already settled, which is the cheap common case; and what gets
     * scheduled is `_pm_settle`, which re-checks `done()` **inside the loop callback**. Only the
     * second is a guarantee: the check here and the callback are separated by a hand-off to another
     * thread, and the cancellation can land in between.
