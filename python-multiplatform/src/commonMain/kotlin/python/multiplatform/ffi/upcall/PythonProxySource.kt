/**
 * The Python half of `docs/upcall-async-design.md` §8.6's second gap: the `async def` proxy that
 * makes `await kotlin_fn(x)` read the same whether the Kotlin body suspended or not.
 *
 * Until this existed, `AsyncUpcallDeliveryTest` wrote that proxy by hand (`_await_kotlin`) and the
 * design doc said so. The shape is not optional and not a convenience: `AsyncUpcall.deliver` returns
 * **two different Python types for one Kotlin declaration** -- the real value when the coroutine had
 * already finished, an `asyncio.Future` when it had not -- because the fast path must not be made to
 * pay for an event loop it does not need. Something has to reconcile that, and an `async def` that
 * awaits its result only when the result is awaitable is the only place it can be done without
 * giving the fast path a `Future` too.
 *
 * ### Where this is generated, and why not at build time
 *
 * The two candidates were a `.py` file emitted by KSP and shipped as a resource, and Python source
 * rendered at run time and `exec`'d. This is the second, for three reasons:
 *
 * 1. **There is no resource path to put a `.py` on that works everywhere.** Kotlin/Native has no
 *    `getResourceAsStream`, and the interpreter's `sys.path` on iOS, androidNative and wasm points
 *    at the per-platform CPython trees under `src/nativeInterop/cinterop/lib/...`. `Python3.exec`
 *    already works on all five.
 *
 *    This reason used to end "...is a per-platform packaging problem this repository has not solved
 *    for anything", and that half is no longer true.
 *    [python.multiplatform.env.PythonPayload] puts a directory on `sys.path` before the first
 *    import, and desktop and Android have a real packaging step feeding it -- a jar resource that
 *    is extracted, an APK asset that is unpacked. What still holds is the part this reason rests
 *    on: there is no such step on **iOS** (it needs an Xcode build phase nobody has written),
 *    androidNative or wasm, so a file shipped that way would exist on two platforms out of five.
 *    Reason 2 below would hold even if all five had one.
 * 2. **KSP does not know what will be installed.** A fragment is per Kotlin module; the table is
 *    assembled at run time by `UpcallTable.install`, and an application may install a subset (every
 *    test in this repository does). Build-time Python would describe a table that may never exist,
 *    and would have to be re-aggregated across klibs at run time anyway -- which is this, with less
 *    information.
 * 3. **`ExposedCallable` already carries everything.** [ExposedCallable.isSuspend],
 *    [ExposedCallable.arity] and [ExposedCallable.kind] are exactly the inputs, and they are on the
 *    entry KSP already emits. Emitting Python from KSP as well would duplicate that knowledge into a
 *    second generator that can disagree with the first.
 *
 * What is kept from the build-time option is the part that actually mattered: [render] is a **pure
 * function from entries to source text**, so it is pinned by `PythonProxySourceTest` in `commonTest`
 * with no interpreter anywhere, and the generated module is a readable artefact rather than a
 * behaviour. [install] is the only part that needs CPython, and it does nothing but `exec` what
 * [render] returned.
 *
 * ### GraalVM native image
 *
 * `CLAUDE.md` requires upcalls to survive a closed-world native image, which is why §7 chose
 * build-time tables over run-time reflection. Nothing here reintroduces that risk: this generates a
 * *Python* string from data that is already in a statically-emitted Kotlin table. There is no
 * reflection, no class loading and no dynamic Kotlin code -- the closed world stays closed.
 * (Unverified here: no native image was built for this change.)
 *
 * ### Instance surfaces: [CallableKind.METHOD], [CallableKind.GETTER], [CallableKind.SETTER]
 *
 * These need a receiver, which a bare module function has nowhere to put. [render] takes the
 * matching [ReflectedClass] descriptors and, for each one, emits a plain Python `class` whose
 * `__init__` (if a `CONSTRUCTOR` entry exists) calls through to Kotlin and stashes the resulting
 * handle in `self._pm_handle`, and whose methods and properties pass that handle as `args[0]` --
 * exactly the shape `pm_invoke` already expects for a receiver-carrying entry.
 *
 * #### Who gives the handle back
 *
 * A [python.multiplatform.reflection.HandleTable] entry is a **strong Kotlin reference that the
 * Python side owns**, and that table's own class doc names the counterpart precisely: *"the proxy's
 * `tp_dealloc` calling `release` is the entire lifetime contract."* Until [renderClass] emitted a
 * `__del__`, nothing kept it. `GeneratedProxyCostTest` measured the consequence without looking for
 * it -- its constructor row builds ten thousand `Counter(10)`s and discards every one, and the run
 * ended with **78 002 live handles**, i.e. every Kotlin object Python had finished with was still
 * rooted. `ProxyHandleLifetimeTest` is the direct statement of it, and it fails on desktop *and* on
 * the iOS simulator identically (64 registered, 64 still live after `gc.collect()`): this was never
 * a per-platform problem, because the generated Python is `commonMain`'s.
 *
 * `__del__` is `tp_finalize`, which `tp_dealloc` runs -- so it is literally the mechanism that doc
 * names, not a stand-in for it. The objection to it is historical: before PEP 442 (CPython 3.4) an
 * object with `__del__` in a reference cycle was never finalised at all and went to `gc.garbage`.
 * That has not been true for a decade, and [ProxyHandleLifetimeTest] pins it rather than trusting
 * it -- it builds a cycle through the proxy on purpose, drops it, collects, and requires the
 * handles back.
 *
 * The alternatives are all *more* robust in one specific way and cost between two and nine times
 * as much, measured on CPython 3.13 as construct-plus-destruct, net of a plain object of the same
 * shape:
 *
 * | alternative | net | why not |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `__del__` (**this**) | **+66 ns** | -- |
 * | a per-instance holder object whose own `__del__` releases | +158 ns | immune to a subclass shadowing `__del__`, at the price of a second allocation per proxy and a second name in the instance dict |
 * | `weakref.ref(self, cb)` in a module-level registry | +260 ns | the same immunity, plus a registry entry to insert and remove per proxy |
 * | `weakref.finalize(self, _pm_release, h)` | +555 ns | the same again, and it costs about as much as the entire boundary crossing it is protecting -- the constructor row is ~610 ns net, so this alone would roughly double it |
 *
 * The one thing `__del__` does not survive is a **subclass that defines its own `__del__` and does
 * not call `super().__del__()`** -- measured, not assumed: the handle is silently never released.
 * That is accepted because a subclass that overrides `__init__` without calling `super().__init__()`
 * already breaks the same object more thoroughly (there is no `_pm_handle` at all), so the generated
 * class already depends on a subclass cooperating with it, and paying 2.4x on every construction to
 * harden one half of that dependency buys little.
 *
 * The release is looked up **once, at class-definition time**, and carried as a default argument;
 * see `_pm_releaser` for why reading it out of globals inside `__del__` is not the same thing.
 *
 * This deliberately does **not** go through [python.multiplatform.ffi.ProxyTypeFactory]'s
 * `PyType_FromSpec` type. That type exists for one thing: giving a Kotlin-held Python reference a
 * `tp_traverse`/`tp_clear`/`tp_dealloc` slot so CPython's cyclic collector can see through it
 * (`CycleCollectionTest`). It carries no `tp_call`, `tp_methods` or `tp_getset` -- nothing that
 * would let Python *call into* Kotlin -- and nothing in this codebase wires a `TypeTag.OBJECT`
 * return into an instance of it; [UpcallTrampoline.marshalResult] hands back a bare
 * [python.multiplatform.reflection.HandleTable] integer today. A receiver in this design is
 * therefore just that integer, and a plain Python class holding one in an attribute is sufficient
 * -- no C type, no new slot, no new platform code.
 *
 * ### Static surfaces: [CallableKind.STATIC_GETTER], [CallableKind.STATIC_SETTER], and a
 * companion's [CallableKind.FUNCTION]
 *
 * A static property is an **attribute**, not a callable: rendering it as `libraryVersion()` would
 * make the Python surface disagree with the Kotlin declaration, and rendering it as a plain
 * assignment at install time would freeze a `var` at whatever it held then. So it has to be a
 * descriptor, and the only question is what object carries it. There are two answers because there
 * are two owners:
 *
 * - **A static member of a class that gets a Python `class`** (a `companion object` member, which
 *   `FragmentScanner` folds into the owner's name) goes on a **metaclass** rendered beside the
 *   class. A `property` in the class body would answer `instance.x`, not `Foo.x`; a descriptor
 *   answers for the object whose *type* carries it, so for the class object itself to read and
 *   write, the descriptor must live on the class's type. This also reproduces Kotlin's own rule
 *   for free -- a companion member is reached through the class and **not** through an instance,
 *   and a metaclass attribute is invisible to instances for exactly the same reason.
 * - **Everything else static** -- a top-level property, and the members of a `ReflectedClassKind`
 *   this stage does not render as a class ([ReflectedClassKind.OBJECT], [ReflectedClassKind.ENUM])
 *   -- becomes a live attribute of the module its name points at. That is not a second design so
 *   much as the same one applied to the module: the module object is reclassed onto a `ModuleType`
 *   subclass generated **for that module alone**, and the descriptor goes on it, exactly as a
 *   class's static goes on that class's metaclass. Per module rather than one shared subclass
 *   because the descriptor is named after the Kotlin declaration, and a shared type would answer
 *   `demo.calc.tally` on every other proxy module too.
 *
 *   This was a `__getattr__`/`__setattr__` pair on one shared `_PmModule` subclass first, which is
 *   correct and is roughly fifty times more expensive per read. `__getattr__` is the *fallback*
 *   hook: it runs only once normal lookup has failed, and on a module "failed" means
 *   `module_getattro` has already built and raised the formatted "module has no attribute"
 *   `AttributeError` for the hook to catch and discard. `GeneratedProxyCostTest` priced that at
 *   551-587 ns per read on desktop, net of the boundary call underneath it -- against 6-14 ns for
 *   the descriptor, and against 8-28 ns for the metaclass path doing the same job for a class.
 *   A data descriptor is consulted ahead of the instance dict in both directions, so it also
 *   removes the need for a `__setattr__` hook: a `property` with no usable `fset` refuses the
 *   assignment on its own.
 *
 * Putting an `object`'s properties on the module rather than on a class of its own is what keeps
 * `Registry.ping()` and `Registry.size` resolving against the same Python object: `ping` is a
 * [CallableKind.FUNCTION] entry named `..Registry.ping` and has always gone through the module
 * path, so its sibling property has to follow it there.
 *
 * #### A companion **function** goes on the metaclass too
 *
 * `FragmentScanner.companionEntries` emits a companion function as a [CallableKind.FUNCTION] named
 * `pkg.Owner.fn` -- the same shape an `object`'s function has, and indistinguishable from it by
 * name alone. Sent down the module path it landed in a module `pkg.Owner`, which [renderClass] then
 * overwrote on the parent module with the class of that name. **Observed, in a real interpreter:**
 * `Counter.make(3)` raised `type object 'Counter' has no attribute 'make'` while a
 * `sys.modules['proxycls.Counter']` that still held `make` was left behind -- one Kotlin name with
 * two contradictory Python answers, only one of which anything pointed at.
 *
 * The judgement is that **one Python name cannot be both a module and a class**, so one of the two
 * has to move, and it is the function: the class is the thing an instance surface needs. That puts
 * it on the metaclass beside the static properties, which also gets Kotlin's own rule for free.
 * Rejected:
 *
 * | alternative | why not |
 * |---|---|
 * | a `staticmethod`/`classmethod` in the **class body** | reachable through an *instance* (`Counter(1).make(3)` resolves), which is a shape Kotlin does not have -- and it would contradict the sibling static *property*, which is on the metaclass precisely so instances cannot see it. The two halves of one companion would then disagree about what a companion is |
 * | merging the module into the class (the class absorbs the module's attributes) | the collision is only ever between a class and a module named after that class, i.e. between a class and its own companion. Building a general module/class merge for one case buys nothing the metaclass does not, and gives `pkg.Owner` a `__getattr__` that has to arbitrate between two namespaces |
 * | reversing the publication order so the module wins | the same bug pointed the other way: `Counter(1)` would stop working, and an instance surface is what the class rendering exists for. It also leaves the loser in `sys.modules`/on the parent module rather than removing it |
 *
 * An `object`'s function is deliberately **not** moved: a [ReflectedClassKind.OBJECT] is not
 * rendered as a Python class, so nothing overwrites its module and `Registry.ping()` and
 * `Registry.size` keep resolving against the same module object.
 *
 * #### What this cost, and the alternatives it was chosen over
 *
 * The price is one extra type object per class that has static members, and one more shape in the
 * generated source for a reader to account for. It is paid only where there is something to put on
 * it -- a class with no statics still renders as a bare `class Foo:`. The alternatives:
 *
 * | alternative | why not |
 * |---|---|
 * | accessor pair (`Foo.get_count()` / `Foo.set_count(v)`) | no metaclass, but it is the same disagreement between the Python surface and the Kotlin declaration that ruled out rendering the property as a callable in the first place. Rejecting it for a `val` and accepting it for a companion `val` would be arbitrary |
 * | module-level accessors (`fixture.library.WithCompanion_count`) | mangles the name, and `WithCompanion` is already taken as a module by the companion's *functions*, so the two halves of one companion would live in different places |
 * | a C type with `tp_getset` via [python.multiplatform.ffi.ProxyTypeFactory] | new platform C on five targets, for something a pure-Python descriptor already does. The same argument the instance section above makes against that type |
 *
 * The setter half follows `docs/binding-policy.md` rather than restating it: a `val`, or a `var`
 * whose setter is `private`/`protected`/`internal`, simply has no `STATIC_SETTER` entry, so this
 * renders a `property` with no `fset` on a class, and on a module one whose `fset` raises with the
 * Kotlin declaration's name in the message. The assignment fails with `AttributeError` instead of
 * silently binding a plain attribute that would shadow the Kotlin declaration for every later read.
 *
 * ### A `TypeTag.OBJECT` **result**, and who owns it
 *
 * This used to be the whole of the section below: a `TypeTag.OBJECT` value returned from an
 * ordinary [CallableKind.FUNCTION] crossed as the bare handle integer, and *"that int is the
 * caller's to release"*, because an integer has nothing to hang a `__del__` off. The path that made
 * the cost of it visible is `docs/kotlin-extensions-in-python.md` §3.2's Compose chain --
 * `Modifier.padding(16.dp).size(24.dp)`, assembled from Python out of Compose's own jars, where
 * every link is exactly that shape. §6 records the consequence: **one leaked root per intermediate
 * link**, and Compose modifiers are written long, so the leak grows with how idiomatic the calling
 * code is. `WalkedArtifactComposeModifierTest` leaked three per run and said so in its own KDoc.
 *
 * What that needed is a *Python object* to hand back instead, since that is the only thing a
 * finaliser can live on. [OWNED_HANDLE] renders it: `_PmObject`, an owner carrying the handle in a
 * slot and giving it back in `__del__`. `_pm_own` puts a result into one and `_pm_unwrap` takes it
 * back out on the way in, so `size(padding(m, 16.0), 24.0)` still passes a handle to Kotlin and
 * chaining costs one `isinstance` per OBJECT argument. Every rendered class derives from the same
 * owner, so there is one notion of "a Python object holding a Kotlin root" rather than two.
 *
 * #### Where a class with a metaclass gets that base from
 *
 * A class with static members already has a metaclass, and the two requirements do not both fit in
 * a base list: Python has no syntax for a base *after* a keyword, so the only spelling available is
 * `class Foo(_PmObject, metaclass=_pm_t_1):` -- which separates the class from the metaclass a
 * reader is pairing it with, and did more than that. `ksp-fixtures:app` locates a companion by
 * matching `class (_pm_t_\d+)\(type\):` lazily through to `class Foo\(metaclass=\1\):`, and once
 * that terminator no longer existed the match could not complete: `java.util.regex`'s lazy loop
 * recurses once per character, so it scanned the rest of a 30 KB module and raised
 * **StackOverflowError** instead of returning no match. Two fixture tests failed with a stack
 * overflow that said nothing about rendering.
 *
 * So the base comes from the metaclass instead -- `__new__ = _pm_owned_new`, one line at the top of
 * the metaclass body, appending `_PmObject` to `bases` unless something there already is one. The
 * class statement stays adjacent to its metaclass and says only what is specific to it, a class
 * with no statics still names its base outright (`class Counter(_PmObject):`), and a Python
 * subclass of a rendered class inherits the metaclass without collecting a duplicate base.
 *
 * **It is gated on the producer having named the return type**, and [ownedTypeOf] is where the
 * reason is written out: `OBJECT` means two different things in the result direction and the tag
 * alone cannot separate them. The walker names its return types; KSP does not, so the KSP path
 * keeps the bare-handle contract exactly as [ProxyHandleLifetimeTest] pins it.
 *
 * ### What is still not rendered
 *
 * | kind | why not |
 * |---|---|
 * | a `TypeTag.OBJECT` result wrapped in the **class rendered for its type** | an owned result is a generic `_PmObject`, not a `Counter`. Nothing would be gained today: the walker emits no `ReflectedClass` at all (`ArtifactScanner` records constructors as needing one "which is the next step"), so no rendered class has ever shared a name with a walked return type. `docs/kotlin-extensions-in-python.md` §4.1's per-receiver proxy is where that belongs, and `_pm_type` carries the Kotlin type name so it has something to key on |
 * | a `TypeTag.OBJECT` result read through a **module attribute** (a top-level or `object` property) | `_pm_static_property` is one shared descriptor for every module attribute and does not see the entry, so owning there means either a `_pm_own` call on the read path of *every* top-level `val` -- a row `GeneratedProxyCostTest` measures at 6-14 ns, which this would multiply -- or a second copy of the descriptor. Neither is worth building for a case no producer reaches: KSP emits no return type name, and the walker emits no properties |
 *
 * These are skipped silently *here* because the skip is a property of this stage, not a policy
 * decision -- `docs/binding-policy.md` already decided they are exposed, and they remain reachable
 * through the raw boundary. What is missing is only the sugar.
