/**
 * `pythonx` -- the hand-written Python that adapts the Kotlin declarations, and the generated table
 * it reads.
 *
 * `docs/pythonx-adapter-design.md` §7 draws one line through this whole area: **if it differs per
 * Kotlin declaration it is generated or resolved at run time; if it is the same rule for every
 * declaration it is `pythonx` Python source.** This object is where the two meet, and it keeps them
 * apart on purpose:
 *
 * | | what | who wrote it |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | [SOURCE] | the finder, the name rule, the overload dispatcher, the receiver proxies | a person, once. It names no Kotlin declaration anywhere |
 * | [renderTable] | one row per entry in [UpcallTable] | this function, from the table |
 *
 * The 2024 `pythonx-compose` put both on the wrong side of that line -- a Python file per Compose
 * component, 37 of them, 28 empty -- and `docs/pythonx-adapter-design.md` §1 measures what it cost:
 * `padding()` composed nothing and `fill_max_size()` returned `self`, because a per-declaration
 * wrapper is written once and then never again. Nothing here is per-declaration.
 *
 * ### What the Python needs from the host, and what it does not
 *
 * The same two names [python.multiplatform.ffi.upcall.PythonProxySource] needs -- `_pm_resolve` and
 * `_pm_invoke` in `__main__` -- plus `_pm_release` if handles are to be given back. It does **not**
 * need `PythonProxySource.install()`: the eager whole-table render and this lazy one are two
 * independent consumers of the same boundary, and `PythonxAdapterTest` installs only this one.
 * That is §2.3's laziness claim made executable rather than argued.
 *
 * ### Why the source is a Kotlin string and not a `.py` file
 *
 * The same reason [python.multiplatform.ffi.upcall.PythonProxySource] gives, and §2.5 restates for
 * this layer specifically: **there is no resource path to put a `.py` on.** Kotlin/Native has no
 * `getResourceAsStream`, and `sys.path` on iOS, androidNative and wasm points into the per-platform
 * CPython trees under `src/nativeInterop/cinterop/lib/...`. `Python3.exec` works on all five today
 * and nothing else does.
 *
 * This is the third candidate §2.5 lists, and its cost is named there and not disputed here: the
 * source is hostile to editing, diffing and shipping to PyPI, which `pythonx-compose`'s
 * `pyproject.toml` says it is eventually meant to do. **§2.5 stays open.** What is *not* paid is
 * duplication: this is the only copy, so there is nothing for a `.py` beside it to drift from.
 *
 * One mechanical constraint follows from the delivery route and is worth stating where it can be
 * broken: [SOURCE] is handed to Python inside an `r"""..."""` literal, so it must contain no triple
 * double-quote and must not end in a backslash. Its docstrings are `'''` for exactly that reason.
 * [render] checks it rather than leaving the failure to a `SyntaxError` at `exec` time.
 *
 * ### GraalVM native image
 *
 * Unchanged from `PythonProxySource`: this renders a *Python* string out of data that is already in
 * a statically-emitted Kotlin table. No reflection, no class loading, no dynamic Kotlin. The closed
 * world stays closed. (Unverified here: no native image was built for this change.)

            ### The measurement this answers

            `RecompositionAccumulationTest` composes one body twelve times and counted, before this
            existed, twelve wrappers, twelve `HandleTable` roots and twelve Python references held --
            for one `content=`. All of it comes back at disposal, so it is not a leak; it is a live UI
            growing linearly in frames, and a UI recomposes several times a second.

            ### Why identity is not the criterion

            `content=lambda: Text('hi')` builds a **new function object on every pass**, so `id(value)`
            is a fresh number every time and interns nothing at all -- and that is the spelling every
            example in this module uses. Two lambdas written at one source position are nonetheless
            the same callable in every sense that matters here, and CPython says so structurally: the
            code object is stored in the enclosing code's constants and is therefore *one* object for
            the life of the module. So the key is built out of what the callable is made of:

            | part | why it is in the key |
            |---|---|
            | `__code__`, **by value** (`_code_key`) | the body. Its *address* is no good: `PythonComposition` `exec`s a source string, so every pass compiles a new code object |
            | `__globals__` | the same source in two modules is two callables |
            | `__closure__` cell **contents** | `lambda: Text(n)` for two `n`s does two things |
            | `__defaults__`, `__kwdefaults__` | same, spelled differently |
            | `__self__` for a bound method | `a.on_click` and `b.on_click` are not interchangeable |
            | the slot | a wrapper carries its invocation convention: a composable `content` threads a composer and an `onClick` does not, and one object cannot be both |

            Captured values are compared **by address, not by `==`**, so a capture that changed to an
            equal-but-distinct object misses and gets its own wrapper. That is the conservative
            direction: a miss costs a wrapper, a wrong hit renders a stale frame.

            ### Why addresses are sound here and would not be in a plain memo

            An `id()` is only unambiguous while its object is alive, and CPython reuses addresses
            eagerly. Every key this returns is stored by `PythonCallableScope`, whose entry roots a
            wrapper that holds the callable -- which holds its cells, its cell *contents*, its
            defaults, its globals and its receiver. Nothing a live key names can have been freed, so
            no two distinct callables can collide. A cache that did not hold its keys' objects alive
            could not make that argument, which is why this table lives on the Kotlin scope. (The
            code object is the exception and is keyed by value; see `_code_key` for why it has to be.)

            The one case where a cell can outlive what the key said it held is a rebound variable in
            a shared enclosing frame -- and there the *cached* callable's cell is the same cell, so it
            sees the new value too and the two agree anyway.

            ### What returns `''`

            A callable with no `__code__` at all -- a C builtin, a `functools.partial`, an instance
            with `__call__` -- and a closure cell that is still empty (a recursive definition being
            defined). Those get a wrapper per crossing, which is what everything got before.

            The wrapper belongs to the enclosing `PythonCallables` scope, which is the composition's:
            Compose stores a `content` in the slot table and calls it on later recompositions, long
            after the statement that wrote `content=lambda: ...` dropped Python's last reference to
            it. A bare handle is what comes back, which is exactly what an OBJECT slot takes.

            **The scope is asked for an existing wrapper first**, and that lookup is a separate entry
            point rather than a flag on `newFunction` so that a hit costs one crossing and nothing
            else: `_positional_capacity` runs `inspect.signature`, which is the most expensive thing
            on this path, and `_callable_thunk` allocates a closure. A recomposing composition takes
            the hit path on every pass after the first, so those are exactly the costs worth not
            paying twelve times for one `content=`.

            A **miss** pays for the lookup on top of everything it paid before -- one `_resolve` and
            one `invoke` that answer nothing. That is the trade, and no wall-clock figure is claimed
            for either side of it (`agent-rules` §11): what is measured here is allocation, in
            `RecompositionAccumulationTest`, and the machine that ran it was not idle.

            -- `${'$'}default & 2` guarding the assignment to parameter 1 (`modifier`), `& 4` guarding
            parameter 2 (`color`), `& 8` parameter 3, and so on with no gaps. Bits are assigned to
            *every* parameter in declaration order, including ones that declare no default (`text`
            owns bit 0 and nothing ever sets it), so the bit index is the parameter index and needs
            no correction.

            ### Except for a receiver, which is the one correction

            `${'$'}default` bits are assigned over **value** parameters, and an extension composable's
            receiver is not one. Measured the same way, on `androidx/compose/material3/NavigationBarKt`
            -- `RowScope.NavigationBarItem(selected, onClick, icon, modifier = …)` guards its
            `modifier` with `${'$'}default & 8`, the **4th** value parameter's bit, although `modifier`
            is slot 4 of the binding once the receiver is counted. The receiver is given bit **31**
            instead (`& -2147483648` in the prologue), which nothing here ever sets because a receiver
            cannot be omitted.

            `${'$'}changed` numbers the other way -- the receiver *is* slot 0 there -- and it does not
            matter, because `${'$'}changed` is passed as 0. That is the conservative value: it is a
            per-call-site claim about which arguments the *caller* knows to be unchanged, and this
            caller knows nothing. The callee then computes it with `composer.changed(...)` itself,
            which is the branch its prologue takes when `${'$'}changed & mask == 0`.

            and when that still does not separate them, this refuses and names the candidates rather than
            picking one, which is the same rule the walker applies for the same reason.

            to `padding(all:)` in Kotlin for the same reason it does here.

            Where the fewest-defaults score is *equal*, nothing has changed: this still refuses and names
            the candidates. It also parts company with `kotlinc` in one direction and does so knowingly --
            Kotlin reports `padding()` with no arguments as ambiguous between the two- and four-`Dp`
            overloads, where this picks the two-`Dp` one because it fills fewer. Both reach

     * 1. `paramNames` is what makes `padding(horizontal=8, vertical=4)` possible at all.
     * 2. `isExtension` + `receiverTypeName` is what lets an extension become a method on its
     *    receiver, and therefore what makes the chain work.
     * 3. `paramTypeNames` is what lets the allowlist be enforced in Python: a `FLOAT` tag over a
     *    declared type that is not `kotlin.Float` is a value class over a primitive, which is the
     *    only machine-checkable form of "this might pack".
     *
     * A third entry point (`_pm_describe`) on all five bootstraps would have been the alternative.
     * This costs no platform code and cannot disagree with the table, because it *is* the table.
     *
     * 4. `paramHasDefault` is what closes §4.5. It was carried and unused while every generated
     *    Kotlin body passed every argument; a walked body now carries one call expression per subset
     *    of its defaulted parameters and picks between them on `args[i] == null`
     *    (`ArtifactScanner.presenceBranchedCall`), so this column is the list of slots `_bind` may
     *    fill with that sentinel. Nothing about the row *shape* changed to do it, which is why it
