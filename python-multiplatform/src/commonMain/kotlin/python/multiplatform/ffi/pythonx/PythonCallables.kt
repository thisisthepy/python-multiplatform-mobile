/**
 * The other direction: **a Python callable arriving at a Kotlin function-typed parameter.**
 *
 * `docs/pythonx-adapter-design.md` §6 opens by saying the mechanism is half present already --
 * `UpcallTrampoline.toKotlinObject` wraps anything Python sends that is not an integer handle as a
 * `PyObject`, so a `lambda:` does reach Kotlin with a reference of its own. What it reaches is a
 * `PyObject`, and every container composable's `content` slot wants a `kotlin.jvm.functions.FunctionN`.
 * That gap is the whole of why `Column`, `Row`, `Box` and `Button` were reachable only with `content`
 * defaulted -- and `Column`'s `content` declares no default at all, so it was not reachable.
 *
 * ### Why the wrapper can be built without Compose on the classpath
 *
 * A lowered `@Composable ColumnScope.() -> Unit` is, in the compiled form the thunk calls,
 * `Function3<ColumnScope, Composer, Integer, Unit>` -- and generics erase. The thunk's `CHECKCAST` is
 * to `kotlin/jvm/functions/Function3`, and Compose's own call is
 * `Function3.invoke(Object, Object, Object)`. So a Kotlin lambda of type `(Any?, Any?, Any?) -> Unit`
 * written in `commonMain` **is** an admissible `content`, and nothing here has to name `Composer`,
 * `ColumnScope` or any other Compose type. That is what keeps this file in `commonMain`, where the
 * `pythonx` layer it serves already lives, rather than in a Compose-aware module.
 *
 * ### What separates a `Function0` from a composable lambda, and how it is known
 *
 * Not by guessing at the arity. `ArtifactScanner.functionSlotTypeName` compares the two arities the
 * walker already has -- the declared `kotlin.FunctionN` from `@Metadata` against the
 * `Lkotlin/jvm/functions/FunctionM;` in the JVM descriptor -- and a composable lambda is exactly the
 * case `M == N + 2`, because the Compose plugin appends a `Composer` and one `$changed` to the
 * *function type* just as it does to a function. `Button`'s `onClick` is `Function0` in both, so it
 * is plain; `Column`'s `content` is `Function1` declared and `Function3` compiled, so it is lowered.
 * The walker writes the answer into the type name it already carries, and `pythonx` reads it there.
 *
 * The consequence for a caller is the one that matters: a **composable** lambda is invoked with the
 * composer its container established, which is threaded back into `pythonx`'s composer stack for the
 * duration of the call, so a `content` may itself call composables. A **plain** one is not, and
 * receives nothing.
 *
 * ### Lifetime: the scope is the holder, and it is the only one that can be
 *
 * Compose stores a `content` in the slot table and calls it again on later recompositions, so the
 * Python callable has to outlive the call that passed it -- `Column(content=lambda: ...)` drops
 * Python's last reference at the end of the statement. Something on the Kotlin side must hold one.
 *
 * Four candidates, and three of them do not work:
 *
 * | holder | why not |
 * |---|---|
 * | the `PyObject`'s own cleaner | it fires when the *Kotlin* wrapper is collected, which is whenever the collector gets round to it and never on a target without one. `docs/object-lifetime.md`'s point exactly |
 * | `HandleTable` | a strong root nothing gives back: the handle reaches Kotlin as a slot value and is never handed to Python, so there is no `__del__` to hang the release off (`HandleTable`'s own KDoc: "this table leaks by construction") |
 * | the composition **pass** | ends long before Compose stops calling the content |
 * | **[PythonCallableScope]** | lives exactly as long as the composition, because a Compose-side `RememberObserver` closes it in `onForgotten` |
 *
 * So this file owns the first three quarters of that -- creating, holding and releasing -- and the
 * one Compose type involved, `RememberObserver`, stays in the module that has Compose
 * (`:ksp-fixtures:compose`'s `PythonComposition`). `docs/pythonx-adapter-design.md` §6 item 1 names
 * `onForgotten` as "the one that fails silently and should be tested first"; the seam is here and the
 * test is there.
 *
 * ### Interning, and what the holder costs without it
 *
 * The scope releases everything at once, which settles *whether* a callable comes back and says
 * nothing about how much is held meanwhile. `RecompositionAccumulationTest` measured that: one
 * `content=` composed twelve times held **twelve** wrappers, twelve `HandleTable` roots and twelve
 * Python references, all of them until disposal. Linear in frames, and a UI recomposes several times
 * a second.
 *
 * So a crossing now asks the scope for a wrapper it already made before making one. What counts as
 * "already made" is `PythonxAdapter._intern_key`, and it is neither `id()` nor `==`: a `lambda:` is a
 * new object every pass *and* `PythonComposition` `exec`s a source string, so it is a newly compiled
 * one. The key is what the callable is made of -- its code by value, its captures and defaults by
 * address, and the slot it is going into. [PythonCallableScope.reuseCount] reports how many crossings
 * that answered, so "the count stopped growing" cannot be confused with "nothing crossed".
 *
 * Two callables that are genuinely different still get two wrappers, and one closing over a value
 * that changes between passes is genuinely different -- sharing there would leave Compose calling
 * the first pass's capture forever. That case still accumulates, and it is the one a release point
 * would have to solve; `RecompositionAccumulationTest` states its number rather than leaving it to be
 * discovered.
 *
 * ### The release point, and why nothing releases early yet
 *
 * `RememberObserver` is not it and cannot be: a `content` is a *parameter*, not a remembered value,
 * so nothing reports the slot being dropped. The candidate that remains is a sweep at the end of each
 * composition pass -- give back every wrapper the pass neither built nor reused -- and its
 * precondition was measured rather than assumed:
 * `RecompositionAccumulationTest.everyLiveWrapperIsResuppliedOnEveryPassEvenWhenNested` shows a
 * nested `content` re-supplying **both** its wrappers on every pass, so nothing Compose holds goes
 * untouched. That test is the guard a sweep would be built on.
 *
 * It is not built, and the reason is a shape nothing has measured: a slot Compose *retains across a
 * re-supply*. `LaunchedEffect(key) { block }` keeps the block it has when `key` is unchanged, so a
 * pass supplying a different wrapper would leave the retained one untouched and still live -- and a
 * wrapper released while Compose still calls it is `agent-rules` §14's failure, arriving somewhere
 * else. Interning bounds the case that actually recurs; the sweep waits for that measurement.
 *
 * ### Double release
 *
 * [PythonCallableScope.close] reports how many wrappers it released and answers `0` for every call
 * after the first, which is what `PythonxCallableTest` asserts against rather than only asserting
 * that the count came back. `agent-rules` §14 is the reason the two are separate assertions: a
 * reference released twice does not fail where it happens.
 *
 * A wrapper invoked after its scope closed **refuses**. Calling through a released `PyObject` would
 * not raise -- it would decrement whatever now occupies that address.

     * One Kotlin argument on its way into the Python callable.

     *
     * A `when (value) { is Float -> ...; is String -> ... }` would need no tag at all and is wrong,
     * because **the Python side has to make the same decision independently** -- an OBJECT arrives as
     * a handle integer and has to be given a proxy of the declared type, and a `kotlin.Int` arrives
     * as an integer that must stay one. Deciding from the runtime type here and from the declared
     * name there is two rules that can disagree, and the case where they do is silent: a slot
     * declared `kotlin.Number` holding an `Int` would be marshalled as a number and then wrapped as
     * a proxy over the "handle" 5. Both sides therefore read the *same* list, which
     * [PythonCallables.newFunction] checks the length of.
     *
     * Nullability is not in the tag and does not need to be: `null` is `None` whatever the slot
     * said, which is the rule `UpcallTrampoline.toKotlin` already applies in the other direction.
