/**
 * **Invariant: [pointer] is never the null pointer**, and that is enforced by the type system

 *
 * This used to carry a TODO asking for one more null check across `PyObject`, `PyType` and
 * `PyException`. It was audited instead of guessed at: every `EmbedAPI` function that can return
 * `NULL` is declared `NativePointer?`, and all **721** pointer-returning `actual`s -- 179 desktop,
 * 182 android, 181 native, 179 wasmJs -- route their result through a conversion that maps address
 * 0 to Kotlin `null` (`toNativePointerFromRaw`, or Kotlin/Native's `toCPointer()?.let`). Exactly
 * one `expect` returns a non-nullable `NativePointer`, `AddressValue.toNativePointer()`, which
 * converts an already-valid pointer rather than obtaining one. `NativePointer`'s own constructor is
 * `internal`, so no caller outside the FFI layer can fabricate a zero one.
 *
 * So a null from C cannot reach this constructor without an explicit `!!`, and the `?: throw`
 * at each call site is the check -- adding a runtime one here would only re-test what the
 * compiler already proved.
 *
 * One inconsistency the audit did turn up, recorded because nothing tests it: androidMain's
 * `Long.toNativePointer()` uses `if (this > 0)` where every other platform uses `!= 0`. It agrees
 * for every address Android actually hands out (arm64 user-space VAs are well below 2^63), so it
 * is a discrepancy rather than a defect, and it is unreachable from the production path in any
 * case -- `bindings` returns raw longs that go through `toNativePointerFromRaw`.

     *    what the collection wrappers rely on.

     * an aliasing bug rather than a missing feature.
