/**
 * A two-sided view of one value: the live Python object, and its native
 * Kotlin projection of type [T], each materialised on demand and cached.
 *
 * ## What "lazy" means here
 *
 * Laziness is about *when*, not about *how far*. Nothing is converted until
 * [toKotlin]/[toKotlinOrNull] is called; once it is, the value is converted
 * all the way down to native Kotlin types by
 * [python.multiplatform.ffi.types.collections.pyObjectToNative] -- the same
 * recursive walk [ConversionStrategy.NATIVE] performs eagerly. That is the
 * whole difference between the two strategies: TYPED pays for the walk only
 * if someone actually asks, and pays for it once.
 *
 * ## Values with no native Kotlin counterpart
 *
 * An arbitrary user-defined Python object (or any type this library has no
 * dedicated wrapper for) cannot be projected onto a Kotlin value at all --
 * TYPED is as far as it goes, as [ConversionStrategy]'s doc says. Of the
 * three defensible answers (throw / return the [PyObject] unchanged / return
 * null) this interface offers the two honest ones and rejects the third:
 *
 * - [toKotlinOrNull] returns `null`. Nullability is already in the signature,
 *   so the caller is told about the possibility at the type level and can
 *   handle it.
 * - [toKotlin] throws [PyTypeError]. It promises a [T] and cannot deliver
 *   one; failing loudly at the boundary keeps the blame at the conversion.
 * - Returning the [PyObject] unchanged from [toKotlin] is *not* offered. `T`
 *   is erased on every target here, so the unchecked cast would succeed and
 *   the mismatch would only surface at some unrelated use site far from its
 *   cause -- exactly the failure mode that is hardest to debug. Callers who
 *   want the Python object already have it: [toPython] hands it back.
 *
 * Python's `None` is treated the same way by [toKotlin] (it has a Kotlin
 * counterpart -- `null` -- but not a `T`-typed one), and is reported as
 * `null` by [toKotlinOrNull].
 *
 * ## Lifetime rule
 *
 * A cached native value and the [PyObject] it came from have *different*
 * lifetimes, so the rule is: **nothing cached in [cachedNativeValue] may
 * point into Python-owned memory.** It is enforced, not just stated:
 * [isIndependentOfPythonMemory] decides, every store to [cachedNativeValue]
 * on the conversion path goes through it, and a value it rejects is returned
 * but re-converted on the next call instead of kept. The full per-type table
 * -- including the types that are refused outright, and why -- is in
 * `docs/object-lifetime.md`. Case by case, for everything [pyObjectToNative]
 * can produce:
 *
 * - `int`/`float`/`bool` -> Kotlin `Long`/`Double`/`Boolean`.
 *   `PyLong_AsLongLong` and friends copy a scalar out of the object; the
 *   result is a plain Kotlin value that shares nothing with CPython. Safe to
 *   cache, and safe to outlive its source.
 * - `str` -> Kotlin `String`. `PyUnicode_AsUTF8` returns a `const char*`
 *   *owned by CPython*, valid only while the `str` object lives. That
 *   pointer is never cached here and never escapes: each platform binding
 *   decodes it into a Kotlin `String` at the boundary (`toKString()` on
 *   Kotlin/Native, an equivalent copy through Panama on desktop), and the
 *   copy is independent. Cache the `String`; never the pointer.
 * - `list`/`tuple`/`dict`/`set`/`frozenset` -> Kotlin `List`/`Map`/`Set`.
 *   [pyObjectToNative] recurses, so every element is itself already one of
 *   the independent cases above -- no element holds a `PyObject`, a
 *   `NativePointer` or a borrowed C pointer. The container is therefore
 *   independent too. It is, however, a **snapshot**: mutating the Python
 *   container afterwards does not update it. Call [invalidateNativeCache] to
 *   force the next read to re-convert.
 * - `bytes`/`bytearray`/`memoryview` -> **refused.** Their native form is a
 *   pointer into the object's own buffer (`PyBytes_AsStringAndSize` and the
 *   buffer protocol hand out exactly that), and a `bytearray`'s buffer moves
 *   when it is resized. No wrapper converts them, so they take the branch
 *   below rather than acquiring a cache that would outlive what it points at.
 * - anything else (a user-defined class, a subclass of a builtin, `complex`,
 *   ...) -> nothing is cached; [toKotlinOrNull] returns `null` and [toKotlin]
 *   throws.
 *
 * The other direction has the mirror-image rule: [cachedPyObjectValue] must
 * hold an *owned* reference, never a borrowed one, because the proxy can
 * outlive whatever handed the object over. Everything that populates it does
 * so: [PyContext]'s `proxyConvert` hands over either a `typedWrap` wrapper
 * (built `borrowed = true`, which increfs) or, for a type with no dedicated
 * wrapper, a fresh wrapper it increfs for exactly this reason; and
 * [toPython]'s native-to-Python path builds new objects whose sole reference
 * the returned wrapper owns.
 *
 * A [PyValue] a caller constructs directly is the caller's own business, with
 * one exception the rule can rule out on sight: a bare
 * [python.native.ffi.NativePointer] as the initial native value is rejected by
 * [PyValue]'s constructor.
