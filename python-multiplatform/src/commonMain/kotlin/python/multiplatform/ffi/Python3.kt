    /**
     * Runs the module [moduleName] as `__main__`, the way `python -m <moduleName>` does, in an
     * interpreter that is **still alive when this returns**.
     *
     * ### What this is instead of
     *
     * The body this replaces called `Py_RunMain()`, and the reason that is not a bug that can be
     * patched is in the header: `Py_RunMain()` is declared in `cpython/pylifecycle.h` — a
     * *lifecycle* function, and not part of the Limited API this binding otherwise targets — and
     * its contract is to run whatever `PyConfig.run_command`/`run_module`/`run_filename` names
     * **and then finalize Python**. There is no mode in which it leaves the runtime standing. So
     * it destroyed the interpreter it was asked to run a module in, while [isInitialized] still
     * said `true`. (`Py_BytesMain()` is not an escape either: it is the whole CLI `main`, and it
     * reaches the same `Py_RunMain()`. See [runApp].) The same old body also did
     * `sys.argv[1] = ...`, an assignment to an index that need not exist, through
     * `PyRun_SimpleString`, which prints and clears the error indicator so the resulting
     * `IndexError` was invisible.
     *
     * `PyImport_ImportModule(moduleName)` is the other obvious candidate and is *not* the same
     * thing twice over: it runs the module body under its own `__name__`, so the
     * `if __name__ == "__main__":` block that is usually the entire point does not fire, and it
     * caches the module in `sys.modules`, so calling it a second time runs nothing at all.
     *
     * ### What it does
     *
     * `runpy.run_module(moduleName, run_name="__main__", alter_sys=True)` — the standard library's
     * own answer, and the machinery CPython's `-m` switch itself goes through
     * (`runpy._run_module_as_main` shares `_get_module_details`/`_run_code` with it). It touches
     * no lifecycle function, so nothing here can finalize anything. Concretely, `alter_sys=True`
     * makes `runpy._run_module_code` wrap the execution in two context managers:
     *
     * - `_TempModule("__main__")` installs a **fresh** module as `sys.modules["__main__"]` for the
     *   duration and puts the previous one back in `__exit__`. The module therefore gets a clean
     *   `__main__` namespace, and the embedder's own `__main__` — the one [exec] writes into — is
     *   neither read nor written, and is restored whether the module returns or raises.
     * - `_ModifiedArgv0(spec.origin)` points `sys.argv[0]` at the module's file while it runs and
     *   restores it afterwards, which is what `python -m` does.
     *
     * ### `sys.argv`
     *
     * `sys.argv` is set to `[moduleName] + `[args] for the duration and **put back afterwards**,
     * including when the module raises. Two halves to that:
     *
     * - It has to be *set*, because `runpy`'s `_ModifiedArgv0.__enter__` reads `sys.argv[0]`
     *   before writing it. An embedded interpreter is not guaranteed to have a usable one — this
     *   is the same soft spot the old body fell into from the other side.
     * - It has to be *restored*, because it is process-global state that the caller did not ask
     *   to have rewritten. A module run is a nested activity here, not the process's reason for
     *   existing.
     *
     * Element 0 is a placeholder: `runpy` overwrites it with the module's origin, so what the
     * module actually observes is `[<module file>] + `[args], exactly as under `-m`.
     *
     * ### Exceptions, and `sys.exit()`
     *
     * An exception escaping the module body propagates as a [PyException] carrying the real
     * Python type, message and traceback, and the interpreter stays usable — a failing module is
     * an ordinary failure, not a poisoned runtime.
     *
     * `SystemExit` is deliberately **not** in that class. A module written to be run as `__main__`
     * uses `sys.exit(n)` to say "I am done, and this is my status"; CPython's own command line
     * agrees, catching `SystemExit` and turning it into the process exit status rather than
     * printing a traceback. The half of that behaviour an embedder must not inherit is the
     * *process* exit, so the status is returned instead of being acted on:
     *
     * - `sys.exit()` / `sys.exit(None)` / falling off the end of the module → `0`
     * - `sys.exit(n)` for an integer `n` → `n`
     * - `sys.exit(x)` for anything else → `x` is written to `sys.stderr` and `1` is returned,
     *   which is what CPython's `_Py_HandleSystemExit` does with it
     *
     * ### Cost
     *
     * This is not in the same class as [exec] and should not be reached for in a loop: every call
     * goes back through `importlib.util.find_spec`, obtains the module's code object again and
     * builds a fresh namespace. `RunMainTest.runMainCostAgainstExec` prints the measured
     * per-call cost of both side by side.
     *
     * `RunMainTest` is the guard; ROADMAP §12 records the decision.
     *
     * @param moduleName an absolute module or package name, as after `python -m`. A package runs
     *   its `__main__` submodule, since that is what `runpy._get_module_details` resolves to.
     * @param args the arguments the module should see as `sys.argv[1:]`.
     * @return the exit status: 0 for a clean run, otherwise whatever the module passed to
     *   `sys.exit()`.
     * @throws PyException if the module cannot be found, or if it raises anything other than
     *   `SystemExit`.

     *
     * - **`-c <cmd>`** — runs `<cmd>` as a statement sequence in the embedder's own, persistent
     *   `__main__` — the same namespace [exec] writes into. `sys.argv[0]` is `"-c"`, matching
     *   CPython (`python3 -c "import sys;print(sys.argv)" a b` → `['-c', 'a', 'b']`, verified
     *   against the system interpreter while designing this).
     * - **`-m <module>`** — a straight delegation to [runMain], which already *is* `python -m`'s
     *   implementation (`runpy.run_module(..., alter_sys=True)`). Nothing here duplicates it.
     * - **a bare script path** — reads the file (through Python's own `open()`, not a new
     *   per-platform Kotlin file API — `nativeMain` has no filesystem abstraction of its own, and
     *   CPython already has one that works identically everywhere this binding runs) and runs it,
     *   again in the embedder's persistent `__main__`. `sys.argv[0]` is the path exactly as
     *   given — CPython does not resolve it (`cd /tmp && python3 argvtest.py` → `sys.argv[0] ==
     *   'argvtest.py'`, not an absolute path; verified the same way).
     * - **`--` followed by a path** — forces the next token to be read as a script path even if it
     *   looks like an option, mirroring CPython's own observed behaviour: `python3 -- -c args`
     *   does *not* run `-c` as a command, it tries to open a file literally named `-c`. This binding
     *   does not carry `-c`/`-m` support past a leading `--`, since CPython's own parser does not
     *   either once option scanning has been told to stop.
     * - **`-`, and anything else starting with `-`** (`-E -I -S -s -B -O -OO -X -W -u -P` among
     *   them, per the design that fixed this scope) — refused **by name** rather than silently
     *   ignored. `-` means "read the program from stdin", which an embedded interpreter has no
     *   sane default for. The rest are `PyConfig` fields (`isolated`, `use_environment`,
     *   `site_import`, `user_site_directory`, `write_bytecode`, `optimization_level`, `Xoptions`,
     *   warning filters, unbuffered I/O, `safe_path`) that only mean anything **before**
     *   `Py_Initialize()` — this interpreter is already initialized by the time [runApp] is
     *   called, so honouring them would mean either lying about what happened or silently doing
     *   nothing, and the second one is exactly the defect this function used to have. Naming the
     *   option in the refusal is deliberate: a caller who typed `-I` expecting isolation and got a
     *   generic "unsupported" would not necessarily notice their isolation request was dropped.
     * - **empty `args`** — refused the same way, since CPython's own default with nothing on the
     *   command line is also to read from stdin (interactively, if it is a tty).
     *
     * Anything after the mode-selecting token (the command, the module name, or the script path)
     * is passed through verbatim as `sys.argv[1:]` — no re-parsing, so an argument to the
     * caller's own script that happens to start with `-` is never mistaken for one of the options
     * above.
     *
     * ### `sys.exit()`, exceptions, and `sys.argv` restoration
     *
     * Identical contract to [runMain], because it is the same design decision applied to a
     * different execution path: `sys.exit(n)` is this function's return value, not a process
     * exit (`sys.exit()`/`None`/falling off the end → `0`; integer `n` → `n`; anything else is
     * written to `sys.stderr` and reported as `1`, mirroring CPython's `_Py_HandleSystemExit`).
     * Any other exception propagates as a [PyException] with the interpreter left usable.
     * `sys.argv` is set for the duration of the call and restored afterwards, on both the
     * returning and the raising path.
     *
     * @param args the command-line arguments *after* the program name, e.g. `["-c", "print(1)"]`
     *   or `["script.py", "--flag"]` — the same slice `Py_BytesMain(argc, argv)` would see as
     *   `argv[1:]`.
     * @return the exit status: 0 for a clean run, otherwise whatever the program passed to
     *   `sys.exit()`.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if `-c` or `-m` is given with no following argument.
     * @throws UnsupportedOperationException for `-`, empty `args`, `--` with nothing after it, or
     *   any other option that only has meaning before `Py_Initialize()`.
     * @throws PyException if the program raises anything other than `SystemExit`, or if a `-m`
     *   module cannot be found.

    /**
     * CPython defers a set of housekeeping jobs to a *checkpoint* that only the evaluation loop
     * reaches. `_Py_HandlePending` — called from the `_CHECK_PERIODIC` uop that begins every
     * Python-level frame and closes every call instruction — is the single place that
     *
     * - merges the free-threaded build's biased reference-counting queue
     *   (`_PY_EVAL_EXPLICIT_MERGE_BIT` → `_Py_brc_merge_refcounts`),
     * - processes QSBR-deferred frees,
     * - runs a scheduled cyclic collection (`_PY_GC_SCHEDULED_BIT`),
     * - drains the pending-call queue and runs pending signal handlers.
     *
     * An embedder that drives CPython purely through the C API never executes a bytecode frame and
     * therefore never reaches one. On a free-threaded build that is not merely untidy: a
     * `Py_DecRef` issued from a thread that does not own the object cannot run `tp_dealloc` there,
     * so the object is pushed onto its owner's queue and stays alive until the owner reaches a
     * checkpoint. Every reference the cleaner gives back is in exactly that position, so a process
     * that only ever calls `PyObject_Call` grows without bound while its reference counts stay
     * perfectly correct.
     *
     * This is the cheapest way to reach a checkpoint: one call to a cached, empty, Python-level
     * function. It is not `exec("pass")`, which recompiles a module on every call.
     *
     * The merge happens on the **calling** thread, for objects that thread owns. That is the whole
     * reason this is not done from the cleaner: the cleaner owns nothing, so a checkpoint taken
     * there would drain an empty queue while running Python on a thread whose only job is to hand
     * references back. Use [PyGC_Collect] instead if you need to reclaim on behalf of some other
     * thread — it stops the world and merges every thread's queue, at a cost proportional to the
     * heap rather than to the queue.
     *
     * **This is not only a free-threading fix.** `_PY_GC_SCHEDULED_BIT` — the bit `_Py_ScheduleGC`
     * sets on every allocation that crosses a generation threshold — is cleared by the same
     * `_Py_HandlePending` this reaches. That scheduling has been how allocation triggers a cyclic
     * collection since 3.12, on *both* builds. An embedder driving CPython purely through the C
     * API therefore never runs the cyclic collector at all, GIL or not: reference cycles the
     * collector would otherwise break simply accumulate. Calling this reclaims them exactly as it
     * merges the free-threaded queue — one call, one checkpoint, both jobs. See
     * `docs/gc-scheduling-investigation.md` §1 and §6.
     *
     * The trade-off is what runs at the checkpoint, not just what it reclaims: any `__del__`,
     * weakref callback or pending call attached to something the collector or the queue was
     * holding can execute here, inside whatever `withGIL` scope happened to trip the checkpoint —
     * a scope its caller did not ask to yield control from. Measured reentrant-safe (a `__del__`
     * that calls back into Kotlin mid-collection completes without deadlocking, looping or
     * crashing — `GCSchedulingMeasurementTest.testReentrancyDuringCheckpoint`), but it is still a
     * side effect the caller did not request, and is why [autoDrainInterval] defaults to off on
     * the GIL build rather than always on.
     *
     * Safe to call at any time, including before initialisation and on a thread that has never
     * touched Python; it returns without doing anything when there is nothing it may legally do.

     * knowingly, not a free one: a checkpoint can run `__del__`/weakref callbacks/pending calls at
     * a `withGIL` scope exit the caller never asked to yield from. Measured cost when on: ~5.5 ns
     * per outermost scope (~2.9% of the ~190 ns floor), amortised over this interval. Turn it on
     * explicitly, call [drainPendingReleases] to force one checkpoint without changing this, or
     * call [PyGC_Collect] directly for an immediate, unconditional collection — [drainPendingReleases]
     * and `PyGC_Collect` both work regardless of this setting.
