/**
 * Builds the cycle-collecting heap type, and -- on the one target this has been carried all the
 * way through -- puts a real base class in Python's hands for a generated proxy to subclass.
 *
 * `createProxyType()` alone was never the gap: `ROADMAP.md` §7 records that the type it builds has
 * carried `tp_traverse`/`tp_clear`/`tp_dealloc` since `work/cycles` and that a real cycle collects
 * through a hand-built instance of it (`CycleCollectionTest`). What stayed open is that no
 * *production* proxy -- the classes `python.multiplatform.ffi.upcall.PythonProxySource` renders --
 * was ever an instance of it: they store their handle in a Python attribute (`self._pm_handle`),
 * and `tp_traverse` reads it from `PyObject_GetTypeData`, a slot a plain Python attribute never
 * reaches. [installGcBase] is the other half: it publishes the type into `__main__` as
 * `_pm_proxy_base`, and [python.multiplatform.ffi.upcall.PythonProxySource]'s generated `_PmGcObject`
 * subclasses it -- through a `PyMemberDef` carrying `Py_RELATIVE_OFFSET` (CPython 3.12+) named
 * `_pm_handle`, so `self._pm_handle = ...` in the generated `__init__` writes straight into the C
 * slot with no change to the generated Python at all.

     * existing behaviour on every platform. Wiring a target in means giving its `ProxyTypeFactory` a
     * `PyMemberDef`-carrying handle slot (or an equivalent) and an `installGcBase` that publishes
     * the type the same way; `ROADMAP.md` §7 has the per-target notes on what that needs.
