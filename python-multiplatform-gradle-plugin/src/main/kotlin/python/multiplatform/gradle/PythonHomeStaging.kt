/**
 * Staging a CPython prefix for a consumer's build — ROADMAP §15e item 4.
 *
 * ### The gap this closes
 *
 * §15c published the library to `mavenLocal()` and built a genuine external JVM consumer against
 * it. Everything worked *except* start-up: `desktopJar` carries `libpython` for four host
 * platforms under `lib/<platform>/`, and `manager.loadLibPython` finds it there with no wiring at
 * all — but it carries **no standard library**, and `Py_Initialize()` dies with
 * `Fatal Python error: Failed to import encodings module` until `PYTHONHOME` names a prefix that
 * has one. Verified rather than read: the published jar's `lib/` tree is 14 entries, every one of
 * them a shared library.
 *
 * Every path that *produces* such a prefix (`downloadAllPythonBuilds` and its per-platform
 * `downloadPython_*` tasks) lives in `python-multiplatform/build.gradle.kts` and is reachable only
 * by building that repository from source. So a consumer who followed README to the letter had a
 * working interpreter binary, a working object model, working upcalls, and no way to obtain the
 * ~24 MB of Python source files the first `import` needs.
 *
 * ### Why this is a build-time task rather than a runtime helper
 *
 * Android solved the same problem at runtime (`PythonBootstrap`, §15f) because there was no
 * choice: the stdlib has to travel *inside* the APK, so something has to unpack it out of
 * `assets/` on the device. Neither half of that reasoning transfers to desktop, and one of them
 * inverts.
 *
 * - **The bytes do not have to ship in the artifact.** A desktop `PYTHONHOME` may name any path on
 *   the machine, so the prefix can be fetched once per machine and shared by every project on it,
 *   instead of being multiplied into an artifact every consumer downloads. That matters here more
 *   than usual: `desktopJar` is already 87.7 MB for four platforms' `libpython`, and the four
 *   platforms' stdlibs measure a further 43.5 MB compressed (macos-aarch64 8.1, macos-x86_64 7.1,
 *   linux-x86_64 8.2, windows-x86_64 20.1) — for payload of which any one consumer uses exactly
 *   one quarter. Putting per-platform payload into the artifact every platform resolves is the
 *   defect §15d diagnosed when `allMetadataJar` reached 87.4 MB, and it was fixed by *narrowing*
 *   scope, not by accepting the size.
 * - **`PYTHONHOME` cannot be set from inside a running JVM.** CPython reads it with `getenv(3)`,
 *   from the native process environment. Android's helper calls `Os.setenv`; the JVM has no
 *   equivalent — `System.getenv` is an immutable snapshot taken at start-up, and changing it (by
 *   reflection or otherwise) does not touch the native environment CPython actually reads. A
 *   runtime helper would therefore have to reach libc's `setenv` through Panama, which is a
 *   different symbol on Windows (`_putenv_s`), and would then be setting a value that
 *   [python.multiplatform.env.PythonHomeCheck] — which reads `System.getenv` — could no longer
 *   see. Setting it when the *process is launched*, which is what Gradle's `environment(...)`
 *   does, has neither problem: CPython and `PythonHomeCheck` read the same value from the same
 *   place, exactly as they already do for this repository's own `desktopTest`.
 *
 * ### What it deliberately does not do
 *
 * It does not validate the prefix beyond [stdlibMarkerRelativePath], and that marker is the file
 * `PythonHomeCheck.diagnose` itself looks for. A second, independent notion of "usable prefix" is
 * a second thing that can drift from the layout `Py_Initialize()` wants; this produces the layout,
 * that verifies it, on the value this sets.

 *
 * `linux-aarch64` is included even though `desktopJar` carries no `libpython` for it, and that is
