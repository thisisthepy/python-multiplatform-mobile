/**
 * `docs/pyi-generation-design.md` §2.2's declaration model: **one representation, produced by the
 * scanner, consumed by two renderers.**
 *
 * ### Why a third model rather than a widened existing one
 *
 * `python.multiplatform.ksp.CallableEntryModel` and
 * `python.multiplatform.gradle.artifact.ArtifactCallable` are near-identical and both were cut down
 * to *exactly* what a call site needs -- the reasoning `PythonProxySource`'s KDoc gives for
 * `ExposedCallable`. A `.pyi` needs a strict superset of that, because a stub describes a signature
 * and a call site only has to produce one. §2.2 rejects widening either in place: it would put
 * fields on a hot path whose renderer must ignore them, and it would not fix the KSP/ASM asymmetry.
 *
 * §2.1 lists what every existing representation reads and then drops, one function before it would
 * be used: parameter **names**, **defaults**, **nullability**, the **declared Kotlin type**, the
 * **extension-receiver** flag, the **overload grouping**, and **value-class identity**. `958c0082`
 * has since put flat `paramNames`/`paramTypeNames`/`returnTypeName`/`isExtension`/`receiverTypeName`/
 * `paramHasDefault` on `ExposedCallable` for the Python-side dispatcher -- so part of that loss is
 * already repaired, but as strings, without nullability, without type arguments, without value-class
 * identity, and only for declarations that were *bound*. Those four are exactly what a stub cannot do
 * without, which is why this is a model and not six more `List<String>`s.
 *
 * ### One walk
 *
 * §2.2 also rejects "a second scan, independent of the binder's" -- two readers of the same jars that
 * can disagree. So these are built at the point the binding is built, from the same
 * `ResolvedFunction`, inside the same class walk. `ArtifactScanner.scanDeclarations` is that walk
 * with the other half of its result kept.
 *
 * ### Not implemented here
 *
 * The KSP producer (`python-multiplatform-ksp`) does not emit this model yet: KSP sees only the
 * consumer's own source, and the artefact walker is where the third-party surface that motivates
 * stubs comes from. §2.3 records that KSP would need to read *nothing new* to supply it. The klib
 * producer does not exist at all (§0, §7).
 *
 * `Serializable`, along with [DeclaredParameter], [KotlinTypeModel] and [ValueClassModel]: this
 * crosses the `WorkerExecutor` isolation boundary `KlibScanWorkAction` runs `KlibScanner` behind --
 * see that file's KDoc for why the boundary exists at all.
