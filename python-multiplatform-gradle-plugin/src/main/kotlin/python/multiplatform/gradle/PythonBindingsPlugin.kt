/**
 * Which KSP configurations the processor belongs on.
 *
 * KSP creates one configuration per *compilation*, plus several of its own internal ones. The
 * processor belongs on each target's main compilation and nowhere else:
 *
 * - a `...Test` compilation would scan the test sources and emit a *second* `Fragment_<module>`
 *   under the same name, in the same package, in the same module;
 * - `kspCommonMainMetadata` would do the same for `commonMain`, which every platform target
 *   already compiles;
 * - `kspPluginClasspath*` and `...ProcessorClasspath` are KSP's own plumbing;
 * - the bare `ksp` configuration is the single-platform one. Adding to it from a multiplatform
 *   project fails outright -- "The 'ksp' configuration is deprecated in Kotlin Multiplatform
 *   projects. Please use target-specific configurations like 'kspJvm' instead" -- so
 *   [isMultiplatform] decides whether it counts.
 *
 * **A test compilation is not always a name that ends in `Test`.** On a module carrying an Android
 * plugin, KSP names its configurations after AGP's source sets, and AGP puts the build type last:
 *
 *     main          kspAndroid              kspAndroidDebug              kspAndroidRelease
 *     unit test     kspAndroidTest          kspAndroidTestDebug          kspAndroidTestRelease
 *     instrumented  kspAndroidAndroidTest   kspAndroidAndroidTestDebug   kspAndroidAndroidTestRelease
 *     testFixtures  kspAndroidTestFixtures  kspAndroidTestFixturesDebug  kspAndroidTestFixturesRelease
 *
 * so `endsWith("Test")` caught only the variant-less three of those nine. The processor landed on
 * `kspAndroidTestDebug`, scanned the *test* sources, and emitted a second `Fragment_<module>` --
 * and a second `FunctionTable` -- into the test compilation, where they shadowed the real ones
 * from `main`, because a compilation's own generated sources win over its classpath. The symptom
 * is a table holding the test classes and nothing the module actually exposes.
 * `ksp-fixtures/android` is what surfaced this; no module without an Android plugin can.
 *
 * `Test` is therefore matched as a camel-case *word* rather than as a suffix: it must start a word
 * and end one. A target or product flavour genuinely named `testing` is not a test compilation and
 * must keep the processor.
 *
 * Matching on names rather than walking the Kotlin extension's targets keeps this plugin free of
 * a Kotlin Gradle plugin dependency, and so free of its version. The observed name set is pinned
 * in `WiringTest`.

     * Everything `KlibScanWorkAction`'s isolated worker classloader needs beside this plugin's own
     * jar, resolved **in the consumer's project** rather than taken from this plugin's classpath.
     *
     * ### Why it cannot be a plugin dependency
     *
     * `kotlin-compiler-embeddable` on this plugin's runtime classpath becomes `runtime` scope in its
     * published POM, which puts it on the plugin classloader of every build that applies the plugin id
     * -- beside the Kotlin Gradle Plugin's own copy of the same classes. KGP then fails to create its
     * own tasks:
     *
     *     Could not create task of type 'KotlinCompile'.
     *       > Could not generate a decorated class for type KotlinCompile.
     *         > class org.jetbrains.kotlin.build.report.metrics.BuildTimeMetric has interface
     *           org.jetbrains.kotlin.build.report.metrics.BuildPerformanceMetric as super class
     *
     * `./gradlew tasks` failed on that in all three external consumer projects, whether or not they
     * asked for any artefact walking at all. Gradle warns about this jar being on a build classpath
     * ("unpredictable and inconsistent behavior"); in this combination it is not unpredictable, it is a
     * hard failure every time. The worker classloader isolation `KlibScanWorkAction` already has does
     * not help -- that isolates *execution*, and the breakage is the jar merely being *present*.
     *
     * ### Why the whole worker classpath, not only the reader
     *
     * The worker classloader cannot borrow anything from the plugin's own: in an external consumer,
     * every plugin in the same `plugins { }` block shares one classloader, so this plugin's `.urLs`
     * out there include the Kotlin Gradle Plugin's `kotlin-util-klib` -- the exact jar the isolation
     * exists to escape. `KlibScanWorkAction.pluginCodeSource`'s KDoc has the printed list. So the
     * worker's classpath is this configuration plus this plugin's own jar, and nothing else, which is
     * why `kotlin-metadata-jvm` and ASM are named here too even though the plugin already depends on
     * them for the *jar* walker.
     *
     * ### Why detached, and why it costs a consumer nothing
     *
     * `detachedConfiguration` keeps it out of the consumer's own configuration container, so no
     * `configurations.all { }` rule, dependency substitution or platform constraint of theirs can move
     * the versions away from the ones `KlibScanner` was compiled against -- the same reason
     * `configureWasmBrowserRuntimeStaging` uses one. It is only ever resolved from
     * `PythonArtifactBindingsTask`/`PythonStubsTask`'s task action, and only in the klib branch: a
     * consumer walking jars only never downloads it, and a consumer who registers no walker never
     * creates the tasks at all.
     *
     * `Usage=java-runtime` because a bare detached configuration carries no attributes, and these
     * modules publish Gradle module metadata with both an api and a runtime variant to choose between.

     *
     * The obvious spelling -- `dependencies { desktopCompileOnly(files(thunkDir)) }` -- is a
     * **circular task dependency**, and not a subtle one: the walker's own input is
     * `desktopCompileClasspath` (whatever [PythonBindingsExtension.artifactConfiguration] names),
     * both `compileOnly` and `implementation` feed that configuration, so the task would be waiting

     * added *past* the configuration the walker reads.
     *
     * The runtime half has no such problem -- a runtime classpath is not a compile classpath -- so it
     * goes on `<target>RuntimeOnly` the ordinary way, and on the test one beside it, since a `Test`
     * task resolves a classpath of its own.
     *
     * ### Reflection, for the same reason [addKotlinSourceDirectory] uses it
     *
     * This plugin never names a Kotlin Gradle Plugin type at compile time. `getLibraries()` on a
     * Kotlin JVM compile task returns Gradle's own [org.gradle.api.file.ConfigurableFileCollection],
     * so only the lookup is reflective and nothing about the value is.
     *
     * A source set called `<target>Main` compiles in `compileKotlin<Target>`, which is KGP's own
     * convention for a target's main compilation. A name this cannot map is not an error: a build
     * that binds no composable emits no thunk and never reads this classpath entry.
