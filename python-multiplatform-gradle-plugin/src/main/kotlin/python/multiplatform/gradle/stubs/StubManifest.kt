/**
 * `docs/pyi-generation-design.md` §5.3's manifest: which `pythonx` module wraps which Kotlin
 * package, and which value classes may be written as their raw underlying primitive.
 *
 * **The manifest belongs to the Python package, not to this plugin.** §5.2 is the measurement that
 * settles it -- `pythonx.compose.layout` wraps `androidx.compose.foundation.layout`, dropping
 * `foundation.`, and nothing in any artefact says so. Which Kotlin package a `pythonx` module wraps
 * is `pythonx-compose`'s design decision, and hard-coding Compose's renames into a general-purpose
 * Gradle plugin would make every other library's mapping unreachable.
 *
 * §5.3 also gives `docs/kotlin-extensions-in-python.md` §6's open question ("whether the allowlist
 * should be data or code, and where a downstream consumer adds to it") its answer: the same file,
 * in the same package, next to the code whose surface it describes.
 *
 * **Not verified:** no such manifest exists in `pythonx-compose` today and this shape has not been
 * agreed with that repository. What is implemented is the reader.
