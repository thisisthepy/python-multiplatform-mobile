/**
 * `docs/pyi-generation-design.md`'s generator: `.pyi` stubs for the surface the bindings expose.
 *
 * ### Why this is a Gradle task at all
 *
 * `pythonx` adapts Kotlin generically -- a module `__getattr__` finds the binding, adapts it once and
 * caches it -- so **nothing an editor can see is ever enumerated**. The stubs are what pay that back:
 * they carry the fully enumerated Pythonic surface while the runtime enumerates nothing. That
 * generation belongs to the Gradle plugin, the way PyREPL's `createKotlinMetaPackageForPython` did
 * it, is settled (`agent-rules.md` §12) and this task is it.
 *
 * ### What is kept from PyREPL and what is not
 *
 * §1.4's table. Kept: one `__init__.pyi` per package, `...` bodies, the `prepareKotlinIdeaImport`
 * hook. Rejected: `def f(self, *args, **kwargs)` (parameters are the point), the JNI-ish type map
 * (`jint` is not a Python type), dropping names containing `-` (that discards 52 of the 177 chainable
 * `Modifier` extensions), `class StringsKt:` for a file facade, and `meta_json.lock` (Gradle's own
 * up-to-date checking does this, and PyREPL's was disabled anyway).
 *
 * ### Where the output goes
 *
 * `build/generated/pythonStubs/<sourceSet>/`, not the source tree. PyREPL wrote into
 * `src/<sourceSet>/generated/meta/` and got away with it because chaquopy defines a Python
 * source-directory concept a plugin can add to; this repository has no equivalent, and **nothing
 * compiles a `.pyi`**, so there is no `srcDir(task)` to register it with (§6.2). Registering the
 * directory with an interpreter is per-environment -- a chaquopy `sourceSets.srcDirs`, a `.pth` in a
 * venv, PyCharm's interpreter path list -- and **none of that was verified**.
 *
 * ### One walk per task, two tasks
 *
 * This scans the same jars `PythonArtifactBindingsTask` does, in a separate task with its own
 * output. That is two walks of the same artefacts per build, and it is not the failure §2.2 rejects
 * ("two readers of the same jars that can disagree"): both call `ArtifactScanner`, which produces
 * the bindings and the model together and cannot answer the two differently. What is paid is time,
 * and what it buys is that a consumer who wants stubs and no bindings, or the reverse, gets one task.
