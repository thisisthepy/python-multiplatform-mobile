/**
 * The naming rule, forwards and backwards.
 *
 * `docs/pyi-generation-design.md` §3.6: types, objects and composables are PascalCase; functions,
 * methods and parameters are snake_case, which `pythonx-compose`'s `text.py` already does by hand
 * (`font_size` -> `fontSize`, `letter_spacing` -> `letterSpacing`, and 14 more).
 *
 * ### Why the inverse is in the same file and is tested
 *
 * The generator runs the rule forwards and `pythonx`'s adapter has to run it backwards: a module
 * `__getattr__` receives the Python name and has to find the Kotlin declaration. A stub name that
 * does not convert back is a stub promising an attribute the runtime raises `AttributeError` for.
 * So [kotlinNameOf] is not a convenience -- it is the other half of the same rule, and
 * `PythonNameConventionsTest` asserts the round trip over every name it emits rather than over a
 * list of examples.
 *
 * ### The escape, and why there has to be one
 *
 * `fooBar` and `foo_bar` are two different Kotlin declarations and the naive rule maps both to
 * `foo_bar`. An underscore already in the Kotlin name is therefore **doubled**, which makes the
 * inverse total: `_` before a letter means "the next letter was uppercase", `__` means "a literal
 * underscore". Nothing else in the scheme needs a special case.
