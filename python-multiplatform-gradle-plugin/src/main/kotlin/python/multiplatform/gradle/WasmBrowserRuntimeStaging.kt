/**
 * Unpacking `python-multiplatform`'s published wasm browser runtime for a consumer -- ROADMAP §10.
 *
 * ### The gap this closes
 *
 * `python-multiplatform`'s own `stageWasmBrowserRuntime` assembles CPython's Emscripten build plus
 * this library's `cpython.mjs` into a directory a `wasmJsMain.resources.srcDir` can point at, and
 * `:sample` proved that assembling it is enough to make a *browser* bundle come up (not just the
 * node test runner). But that task reads a **local directory** named by `-PwasmPythonDir`, which
 * exists only inside this repository's checkout. An external consumer has no such directory and no
 * way to get one -- the CPython build it names is produced by hand-patching CPython's own source
 * (`Lib/sysconfig`, the generated `Makefile`) against a specific Emscripten SDK version, which is
 * not something any upstream publishes yet. See `build-cpython-abi.sh`'s own header for why: PEP
 * 783's `pyemscripten_2026_0` tag is real and accepted, but nothing ships a `python.wasm` whose
 * `EXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS` include `wasmExports`/`wasmMemory` -- that addition exists only so this
 * library's `@WasmImport` declarations have something to bind to, and no distributor has a reason to
 * carry it.
 *
 * So the *runtime itself* had to become something a consumer's build can resolve, not just
 * something this repository can assemble. `python-multiplatform/build.gradle.kts` zips
 * `stageWasmBrowserRuntime`'s output and publishes it under its own artifact ID
 * (`python-multiplatform-wasm-runtime`), at the library's own version -- so resolving the library
 * and resolving its runtime never drift apart the way two independently-versioned coordinates could.
 * This task is the other half: unpack that zip for whichever build actually needs it.
 *
 * ### Why a detached configuration rather than a task dependency
 *
 * A consumer who never adds a `wasmJs()` target must not need this artifact to exist in `mavenLocal`
 * (or wherever it eventually publishes) at all -- most won't build a browser bundle, and this
 * artifact is ~7 MB compressed. [PythonBindingsPlugin.apply] therefore always *registers* this task
 * (registration is free), but the detached configuration behind [runtimeArtifact] is resolved only
 * when this task actually executes, and it only executes when something depends on it -- which
 * [PythonBindingsPlugin] wires up by matching `wasmJs*` task names, so it only happens for a project
 * that actually has the target.

/**
 * Rewrites a consumer's generated Kotlin/Wasm output so that it can reach the interpreter.
 *
 * Byte-identical in intent to `patchKotlinWasmOutputForCPython` in
 * `python-multiplatform/build.gradle.kts`, and to `:sample`'s own copy of it -- ROADMAP §10 records
 * why there were already two: a Gradle build script's functions are not visible to another
 * project's build script, so every consumer had to carry this by hand. This is the third copy and
 * the one meant to end the duplication -- it lives where [PythonBindingsPlugin] can reach it, so a
 * consumer who applies the plugin does not write it at all.
 *
 * Deliberately free of any Kotlin Gradle Plugin type: it edits generated `.mjs` files with `File` and
 * `Regex`, the same way the two prior copies do, so this plugin's `kotlin-dsl` classpath (Gradle's
 * embedded Kotlin, not this repository's) never needs to see Kotlin/Wasm's task types.
 *
 * @param dir the compile-sync output webpack reads, `build/wasm/packages/<name>/kotlin`.
 * @param modulePrefix the generated module basename, which is `<root project>-<project>`.
