/**
 * `docs/ecosystem.md` §5b's second producer, adapted for Kotlin/Native klibs -- ROADMAP §16e.
 *
 * JVM uses ASM (plus `kotlin-metadata-jvm` for the payload `@Metadata` carries). A klib needs
 * neither: `LibraryAbiReader` decodes the ABI protobuf directly into Kotlin-typed declarations --
 * proper qualified names, `isSuspend`, extension receivers, unerased parameter and return types --
 * so there is no facade problem and no mangled-name problem to work around.
 *
 * ### This walker runs behind a worker classloader boundary, not in the calling task's own classloader
 *
 * Called directly, in the plugin's own classloader, this throws `NoSuchMethodError:
 * KotlinLibraryImplKt.createKotlinLibrary$default(...)` in a real consumer build while passing its own
 * unit tests -- and the difference between those two is the whole problem: in the plugin's test JVM
 * there is one `org.jetbrains.kotlin.library.*` on the classpath, and in a consumer build there are
 * two. The Kotlin Gradle Plugin puts `kotlin-util-klib`/`kotlin-util-io` on the **root project's**
 * buildscript scope, which is a *parent* of the plugin classloader, so parent-first delegation serves
 * half of `org.jetbrains.kotlin.library.*` from KGP's version and half -- the `.abi` half, which only
 * `kotlin-compiler-embeddable` ships -- from this plugin's 2.0.20.
 * `python-multiplatform-gradle-plugin/build.gradle.kts` records the `CodeSource` measurement that
 * proved it and both attempts at aligning the version that failed before classloader isolation was
 * tried. [KlibScanWorkAction] is that isolation: every caller of this object goes through
 * [WorkerExecutor.scanKlibIsolated][python.multiplatform.gradle.artifact.scanKlibIsolated] rather than
 * calling [scanKlib]/[scanKlibDeclarations] directly, and `:ksp-fixtures:klib-artifact
 * :generatePythonArtifactBindings`/`:generatePythonStubs` passing is what confirms the isolation
 * actually holds in a consumer build, not only in this file's own unit tests.
 *
 * **Experimental API usage**, kept entirely inside this file so any break across a Kotlin compiler
 * bump is contained here:
 * - `LibraryAbiReader.readAbiInfo`
 * - `LibraryAbi.topLevelDeclarations.declarations`
 * - `AbiFunction` (`qualifiedName`, `isSuspend`, `isConstructor`, `valueParameters`, `returnType`,
 *   `hasExtensionReceiverParameter`, `contextReceiverParametersCount`)
 * - `AbiValueParameter` (`type`, `hasDefaultArg`)
 * - `AbiQualifiedName` (`packageName`, `relativeName`, `toString`)
 * - `AbiType.Simple` (`classifierReference`, `arguments`, `nullability`) and `AbiTypeNullability`
 * - `AbiTypeArgument.TypeProjection`/`.StarProjection`
 * - `AbiClassifierReference.ClassReference` (`className`)
 *
 * ### Two results from one walk, the same as the JVM producer
 *
 * [scanKlib] returns the bindings, [scanKlibDeclarations] returns one [DeclarationModel] per
 * declaration *including the declined ones*, and both are `.map`s over the same [Candidate] list --
 * `docs/pyi-generation-design.md` §2.2's "one representation, produced by the scanner, consumed by
 * two renderers", which [ArtifactScanner] already satisfies and which this file used not to: it
 * dropped a declaration at a `filter` before anything could record that it had been seen. That is why
 * everything this walker declines is now declined *with a reason* instead of by disappearing, and why
 * klib declarations reach `PythonStubsTask` at all.
 *
 * ### Overload handling matches the JVM producer, not the JVM producer's floor
 *
 * A klib's ABI gives exact Kotlin types the same way `@Metadata` does for a jar, so
 * [ArtifactScanner.disambiguateOverloads] -- the `name__<types>` scheme -- applies unchanged, called
 * here rather than reimplemented. An earlier version of this file dropped every overload group
 * outright, reasoning that Python cannot dispatch on argument type; that reasoning is about
 * arbitration, not naming, and [ArtifactScanner]'s own KDoc already settles it: the JVM producer used
 * to drop for the same reason and stopped once metadata gave it a name to disambiguate by. Doing the
 * opposite here would mean the same `padding`-shaped overload set spells differently depending on
 * which producer found it, which the two producers landing in one
 * `python.multiplatform.generated.artifacts.ArtifactTable` cannot afford.
 *
 * ### What a klib can and cannot fill in the model
 *
 * | [DeclarationModel] field | klib | how |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `simpleName`, `owner` | yes | `AbiQualifiedName`'s two halves, which is *better* than the JVM producer's: no facade to unwrap |
 * | `ownerIsClass` | yes, always `false` | only `topLevelDeclarations` is walked; a class's members live under `AbiClass` |
 * | `isSuspend`, `parameters[].declaresDefault` | yes | declared on `AbiFunction`/`AbiValueParameter` |
 * | `returnType`, `parameters[].type` incl. nullability and type arguments | yes | `AbiType.Simple`'s `nullability` and `arguments` |
 * | `parameters[].name` | **no** | 2.0.20's `AbiValueParameter` declares exactly five members (`type`, `isVararg`, `hasDefaultArg`, `isNoinline`, `isCrossinline`) and none is a name -- checked with `javap`. `parameterNamesKnown = false` is exactly the case §3.2 already defines for a Java jar built without `-parameters` |
 * | `isComposable` | yes | `AbiAnnotatedEntity.hasAnnotation`; see [COMPOSABLE] for what is and is not proved about it here |
 * | `receiver` | **no** -- and the declaration is declined | see below |
 * | value-class identity (`KotlinTypeModel.valueClass`) | **no** -- and the declaration is declined | see below |
 *
 * The last two rows are the point: they are exactly the two things this walker already refuses to
 * bind, so nothing here is *bound* on a field it had to leave empty. A declaration whose shape klib
 * cannot describe is declined with the reason, not admitted with a hole in it.
 *
 * ### Value classes are declined, not unwrapped -- for now
 *
 * [klibBoundaryTypeOf] recognises only `kotlin`'s own primitives, `String`, `ByteArray` and `Unit`.
 * A value class parameter or return (`androidx.compose.ui.unit.Dp`, `kotlinx.coroutines.CoroutineName`)
 * therefore maps to `null` and the whole declaration is declined -- never partially bound with a raw
 * underlying value standing in for the wrapper, which is what would let `16.0` silently decode as
 * `Dp.Unspecified` the way a naive JVM-descriptor reader would.
 *
 * This is the same *safety* property the JVM producer reached with `resolveKotlinType`, but not the
 * same *reach*: `resolveKotlinType` goes on to construct and unwrap a value class when its
 * constructor and accessor are visible, using `@Metadata`'s payload to know the underlying type and
 * visibility. `AbiClass` (a klib declaration alongside `AbiFunction`) carries `isValue`, but not a
 * value class's underlying type or its constructor's visibility -- that would mean resolving the
 * classifier reference to its own `AbiClass`, finding its constructor among its declarations, and
 * reading the *visibility* off it, none of which `AbiDeclarationWithModality` exposes (it carries
 * modality -- `open`/`final`/`abstract` -- not visibility). Doing that safely is a second walker,
 * not an extension of this one, and is left for the next pass rather than guessed at here. The model
 * says so too: `KotlinTypeModel.valueClass` stays `null` for every klib type rather than claiming a
 * `ValueClassModel` this walker cannot fill.
 *
 * ### Extension functions are declined, not bound -- a version floor, verified rather than assumed
 *
 * The JVM producer binds an extension by reading its receiver's *type* off `KmFunction
 * .receiverParameterType` (`kotlin-metadata-jvm`). The klib equivalent would be
 * `AbiValueParameterKind.EXTENSION_RECEIVER` surfacing the receiver inside `AbiFunction
 * .valueParameters`, typed the same as any other parameter -- and that shape exists, but only from
 * `kotlin-compiler-embeddable` **2.2.20** onward. This build pins **2.0.20**
 * (`python-multiplatform-gradle-plugin/build.gradle.kts`), whose `AbiValueParameter` carries no
 * `kind` at all and whose `AbiFunction` exposes only `hasExtensionReceiverParameter: Boolean` --
 * *that* one exists, but nothing behind it gives the receiver's type. Checked by decompiling both
 * jars' `AbiFunction`/`AbiValueParameter` class files with `javap`, not inferred from a changelog:
 * `2.0.20`'s `AbiFunction.class` is 1713 bytes against `2.2.20`'s 2417, and the extra bytes are
 * exactly `getHasExtensionReceiverParameter$annotations`, `getContextReceiverParametersCount` and
 * the `kind`-bearing `AbiValueParameterKind` enum, none of which `2.0.20` has. A function with
 * `hasExtensionReceiverParameter == true` is therefore declined outright here, the same way the
 * pre-metadata JVM producer declined every extension before `kotlin-metadata-jvm` was added --
 * binding one with the wrong arity (mistaking the receiver for absent, or misreading argument N for
 * N+1) would be worse than not binding it. Raising the pin to reach 2.2.20's shape is a real option
 * ROADMAP §16e already names as a cost to weigh (a newer, still-`@ExperimentalLibraryAbiReader`
 * compiler artefact on the plugin classpath) rather than one to spend inside this pass.
