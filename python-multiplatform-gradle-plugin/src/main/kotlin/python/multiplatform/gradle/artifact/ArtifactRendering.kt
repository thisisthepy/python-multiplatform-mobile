 *
 * **A `@Composable` omits by a second mechanism and so has a second piece of evidence.** Its body has
 * no sentinel test and never will: the `$default` bitmask is a *declared trailing parameter* of the
 * JVM method (`docs/pythonx-adapter-design.md` §5.2), so `pythonx` computes an integer instead of
 * writing `None` into a slot, and there is no branch for the body to have. Carrying a [ThunkSpec] is
 * that evidence -- it is set by exactly one path, the one that emits the mask parameter -- so the

 * What separates a declared return type from the types it **is a**, inside the one string the

 * ### Why the answer travels in the type name
 *
 * The same reason `ArtifactScanner.functionSlotTypeName`'s does, and its KDoc makes the argument in
 * full: `ExposedCallable` already carries a declared type name to every target, and a second column
 * that only some producers fill would be one more thing that can disagree with the first. `<:` is not
 * a character sequence a Kotlin fully-qualified name can contain -- neither `<` nor `:` is legal in
 * one -- so nothing legitimate can collide with the grammar, and `pythonx._split_supertypes` is the
 * single reader.
 *
 * It also keeps the change where the two ends of it are. `ExposedCallable` is the runtime's model and
 * is written by KSP as well; a walked jar is the only producer that *has* a class hierarchy to read,
 * and this is the only shape that lets it say so without every other producer growing a field it
 * would leave empty.
