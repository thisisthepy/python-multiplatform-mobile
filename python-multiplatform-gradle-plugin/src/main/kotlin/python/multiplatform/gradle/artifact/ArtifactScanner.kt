/**
 * `docs/ecosystem.md` §5b's second producer: bindings taken out of the artefacts a build resolves,
 * rather than out of the source it compiles.
 *
 * ### Why this exists at all
 *
 * KSP only sees declarations being compiled, so a third-party binary -- `androidx.compose.material3`
 * being the case that motivated it -- can never have a fragment. `PyREPL` already solved the reading
 * half of this: `app/build.gradle.kts` makes a resolvable copy of each source set's
 * `implementation`/`api` configurations and walks the resulting jars with ASM. This is that walk,
 * pointed at a table instead of at `.pyi` stubs.
 *
 * ### Where this parts company with PyREPL's filters
 *
 * PyREPL drops private and protected members, `<init>`, `Companion`, and any name containing `-`.
 * Judged against what a *binding* needs rather than what a stub needs:
 *
 * | PyREPL's filter | here | why |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | not `private`/`protected` | **not enough** — must be `public`, and Kotlin-`public` rather than only JVM-`public` | PyREPL keeps package-private members, which is harmless in a stub; `internal` is JVM-public but not a name generated Kotlin may call |
 * | drop `<init>` | kept | a constructor needs a `ReflectedClass` and a receiver handle, which is the next step |
 * | drop `Companion` | subsumed | only statics are bound, and `Companion` is an instance field |
 * | drop names containing `-` | **not kept** | see below |
 * | (none) | drop non-`static` | an instance method needs a receiver; see [ArtifactCallable] |
 * | (none) | drop unbindable types | see [boundaryTypeOf] and `resolveKotlinType` |
 * | (none) | **rename** ambiguous overloads rather than drop them | see [disambiguateOverloads] |
 * | (none) | drop `suspend` | its JVM shape takes a `Continuation`, and `resolveKotlinType`/`@Metadata` both know this before `boundaryTypeOf` would have to discover it by rejecting the parameter |
 *
 * **Why the `-` filter is gone rather than kept.** A hyphen in a JVM method name is Kotlin's
 * value-class mangling suffix, and it was dropped on the reasoning that a value class *erases to the
 * type it wraps*: `Duration` is a `long`, so `getInWholeSeconds-impl(J)J` would pass [boundaryTypeOf]'s
 * type filter while meaning something entirely different from `long -> long`. That reasoning is sound
 * only if the walker calls the JVM method by its mangled name -- which it never does. It generates
 * *Kotlin source* (`renderArtifactFragmentSource`) and lets `kotlinc` compile it, the same as a
 * human would write `Modifier.padding(16.dp)`; mangling is something the compiler does on the way
 * out, not a name this walker's own generated code ever spells. Filtering on it discarded the
 * declaration a value class exists to describe correctly, for a reason that only applied to a
 * different (rejected) design.
 *
 * What replaced it: `resolveKotlinType` (`KotlinMetadata.kt`), which reads `@Metadata`'s `d1`/`d2`
 * payload to learn the *Kotlin* type a parameter or return actually has -- `Meters`, not the `Double`
 * it erases to -- and, when that type is a value class, whether its constructor and its accessor are
 * public enough to construct and unwrap from generated code outside the module.
 * `kotlin.time.Duration` (`getInWholeSeconds-impl`, the case that motivated the old filter) is
 * *still* declined under the new rule, but for a fact rather than a heuristic: `Duration`'s
 * constructor is `internal`, so no Kotlin source outside `kotlin-stdlib` can ever build one, in
 * either direction. See `ValueClassFixtures.kt`'s `Meters` for the same shape with a public
 * constructor, and `ArtifactScannerTest` for both proved against real bytecode.
 *
 * ### What it takes to reach Compose, and what each piece was worth
 *
 * `docs/kotlin-extensions-in-python.md` §3 measured this walker binding **zero** declarations from
 * all 19 Compose Multiplatform desktop jars, and identified three separate rules each of which
 * produced that zero on its own. All three are now gone, and the measurement that replaced it --
 * `ArtifactScannerTest.composeModifierExtensionsSurviveBothGates`, over the same jars -- is
 * **788 declarations, 157 of them `Modifier` extensions** (314/104 when the three rules below were
 * the whole story; composables and then function-typed slots account for the rest):
 *
 * | rule | what it cost | where it went |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | the metadata-kind gate: only `k=1` (an ordinary class) was dispatched on | **all 1,411** public top-level Compose functions, because a Kotlin top-level function compiles into a file facade (`k=2`) or a multi-file part (`k=5`) | the `when` in [scanClassNode], which now dispatches on `FileFacade` and `MultiFileClassFacade` too |
 * | the type gate: no boundary type for an ordinary object | every remaining declaration, `Modifier` being an interface | `resolveKotlinType`'s object-handle case (`KotlinMetadata.kt`) |
 * | drop a name carried by more than one binding | 33 of `Modifier`'s 130 names, `padding`/`size`/`background`/`border`/`clickable` among them | [disambiguateOverloads] |
 *
 * A fourth rule cost most of what was left. Of the 46 public top-level `Modifier` extensions still
 * declined, **44 declared a function-typed parameter**, because `resolveKotlinType` looks a
 * classifier up as a public class file and Kotlin's built-in `FunctionN` has none. That is
 * [functionSlotOrNull]'s subject, and the same test now measures **157 `Modifier` extensions bound
 * and 8 declined, 6 of them function-typed** -- `clickable`, `combinedClickable`, `semantics`,
 * `drawBehind`, `toggleable` and 45 others where there were none.
 *
 * What is left is not a metadata problem either, and each remaining case has a reason rather than an
 * absence: a `suspend` lambda (`pointerInput`), a `@Composable` lambda inside a declaration that is
 * not one (`composed`), a type argument that is a type *parameter* (`swipeable`). See
 * [functionSlotOrNull].
 *
 * ### Facades, parts, and extension receivers
 *
 * Compose's public surface is not reached by widening [boundaryTypeOf] alone. Two more ASM-only
 * limits stood in the way, and `KotlinMetadata.kt` is what removes them:
 *
 * 1. **Kotlin top-level functions hide behind a facade.** `kotlin.text.trimIndent` compiles onto
 *    the package-private `StringsKt__IndentKt`; the public class `StringsKt` (a
 *    `MULTI_FILE_CLASS_FACADE`) declares no methods of its own, only a list of part class names.
 *    ASM alone can see that the facade exists and that it is public, and nothing past that --
 *    `ArtifactScannerTest.theWholeJUnitJarYieldsExactlyTheseDeclarations`'s Kotlin-jar counterpart
 *    used to pin exactly this limit. `KotlinClassMetadata.MultiFileClassFacade.partClassNames`
 *    supplies the part names; each part's own `@Metadata` (`MultiFileClassPart.kmPackage`) supplies
 *    the real declarations and their true (unmangled) Kotlin names.
 * 2. **An extension receiver is invisible in a JVM descriptor.** `fun Modifier.padding(Dp): Modifier`
 *    compiles to a static method whose *first* JVM parameter is the receiver, indistinguishable by
 *    descriptor alone from an ordinary parameter of the same erased type. `KmFunction
 *    .receiverParameterType` is the only place that survives. Kotlin has no fully-qualified call
 *    syntax for an extension (see [ArtifactCallable.imports]'s KDoc), so a bound extension is called
 *    `receiver.alias(...)` after an `import owner.name as alias` -- the only Kotlin can address it.
 *
 * ### What is still declined, on purpose
 *
 * A value-class *receiver* on a true member of that class (not an extension declared elsewhere) --
 * `Duration.inWholeSeconds` is one -- is declined by [resolveKotlinType] refusing an unreadable
 * constructor, but even a value class with a public one would still be declined here: a member
 * function's own JVM shape puts the (unboxed) instance in JVM parameter position 0 with **no**
 * declared Kotlin parameter to account for it, which the arity check in [scanClassNode] catches as a
 * mismatch. Only a class's plain statics (`@JvmStatic`, a Java `static`) and package-level top-level
 * declarations are bound; instance dispatch is `docs/ecosystem.md` §5b's next step, same as before.
 * `suspend` is declined explicitly via `@Metadata` rather than relying on [boundaryTypeOf] rejecting
 * its `Continuation` parameter, per CLAUDE.md's "제외한 것을 조용히 빠뜨리지 마라".

    /**
     * Gives every member of an overload set a name of its own, instead of dropping the set.
     *
     * ### What changed, and what did not
     *
     * The old rule dropped a Kotlin name outright as soon as more than one binding would carry it.
     * Its reasoning was about **arbitration** and is still right: `org.junit.Assert.assertEquals` has
     * eight bindable overloads, and letting a sort order pick one means `assertEquals(3, 3)` from
     * Python silently calls the deprecated `(double, double)` that always fails. Nothing here picks.
     *
     * What changed is that there is now a third option between "arbitrate" and "drop". The old rule
     * predates `@Metadata`: with only JVM descriptors there was no *Kotlin* parameter type to name an
     * overload by, and 108 mangled JVM names are ambiguous within their own class
     * (`docs/kotlin-extensions-in-python.md` §2.3), so the JVM name could not do it either. Metadata
     * supplies the declared Kotlin types, so the overloads can be **told apart** rather than
     * arbitrated between.
     *
     * The price of not doing so was measured: **33 of `Modifier`'s 130 names**
     * (`docs/kotlin-extensions-in-python.md` §3.1), and the casualty list is the API's centre of
     * gravity -- `padding`, `size`, `background`, `border`, `clickable`, `width`, `height`. For
     * `padding` specifically, the *only* unmangled overload is the `PaddingValues` one nobody wants,
     * so "keep whichever the descriptor-era filter happened to leave" was also the worst answer.
     *
     * ### The rule
     *
     * The bare name is bound only for a group of one. A group of more than one gets one name per
     * member, `name__<types>`, under the first of three schemes that separates the group:
     *
     * 1. the simple names of the declared **value parameters** -- `padding__Dp`, `padding__Dp_Dp`,
     *    `padding__PaddingValues`;
     * 2. the **receiver** joined to them, for overloads that differ only in what they extend
     *    (`Int.times` and `Double.times`, both in `androidx.compose.ui.unit`);
     * 3. **fully qualified** names, for the case where two parameter types share a simple name.
     *
     * A group no scheme separates is dropped, which is the old rule surviving as the floor: two
     * declarations this walker genuinely cannot tell apart must not both claim a table key, and
     * neither may be picked.
     *
     * ### Why a name and not a Python-side dispatcher
     *
     * A dispatcher is the better surface and it cannot be built here. `UpcallTable` is keyed by name
     * and `ExposedCallable` carries one fixed `arity` that `UpcallTrampoline.unmarshalArguments`
     * enforces exactly, so one name reaches one signature by construction; and
     * `PythonProxySource.renderOne` publishes an entry by `setattr`ing its *leaf* name onto a module,
     * so two entries sharing a leaf would silently overwrite each other. A dispatcher therefore lives
     * in `pythonx` (`docs/pythonx-adapter-design.md` §4.1) and selects among these names -- which is
     * why they have to exist and be distinguishable, and why `ExposedCallable` now carries
     * `paramNames` and `paramTypeNames` for it to select on. This layer's job is to make the choice
     * *possible*, not to make it.

     * A class's own public constructors, bound the same way a top-level function is: [constructorsOf]
     * gives each one a [ResolvedFunction] whose name is the class and whose "return type" is the
     * class itself, so the ordinary non-extension call [candidateFromFunction] already writes --
     * `owner.SimpleName(args)` -- is a valid fully-qualified constructor call with no change to that
     * function. `owner` here is the **package**, not the class (contrast [kotlinCandidates]'s own
     * `owner`, which for this same [ownerNode] is the class): a constructor is not a static member of
     * its class, it is the name a caller writes in the class's place, so it publishes the way a
     * top-level function does -- see `docs/pyi-generation-design.md` §2.2's `DeclarationModel.owner`
     * KDoc for why that distinction is what selects the `sys.modules` entry a binding lands on.
     *
     * `<init>` is filtered out of [kotlinCandidates] by that function's own `ACC_STATIC` check (a
     * constructor is never `static`), so nothing here duplicates a declaration that path already
     * handles.
     *
     * ### Why this never looks at [ownerNode]'s own `<init>` bytecode
     *
     * Every other producer in this file cross-checks a [ResolvedFunction] against the real
     * `MethodNode`: the JVM parameter count can exceed the declared one (a composable's synthetic
     * slots, a value class's own member with an implicit unboxed receiver), and only the bytecode
     * says so. A constructor has no such gap -- `KmConstructor.signature`'s descriptor is compiled
     * *from* `valueParameters`, so [ResolvedFunction.allParameterTypes] and the descriptor
     * [candidateFromFunction] needs can both come from the one [KmConstructor], with nothing left for
     * a `MethodNode` to add.
     *
     * Looking one up would actively break value classes. `@JvmInline value class Meters(val value:
     * Double)` declares its constructor with no visibility modifier -- Kotlin-public, same as any
     * other -- but `javap` on the compiled box shows `private fixture.artifactvalueclass.Meters
     * (double)`: the compiler makes the *box's* `<init>` private on purpose, to push every external
     * caller through `constructor-impl`/`box-impl` instead. Matching against `ACC_PUBLIC` bytecode
     * would decline every value class's constructor for a visibility the *language* never gave it --
     * caught by [aValueClasssOwnConstructorRoundTripsThroughItsUnderlyingPrimitive] running red
     * first. Generated Kotlin source is unaffected either way: `Meters(3.0)` is source calling a
     * constructor, and the compiler lowers it through the private box the same as it would inside the
     * declaring module -- nothing here ever spells `<init>` or reads its access flags.

     * `@Retention(AnnotationRetention.BINARY)`. `RuntimeInvisible*` is exactly what ASM puts in
     * `invisibleAnnotations`, so the old predicate answered `false` for **every real composable**,

     * being declined anyway, and a declined entry's flag is not asserted anywhere.
     *
     * Both lists are read rather than just the invisible one: retention is the annotation author's
     * choice and a future Compose could change it, whereas a method carrying the descriptor in
     * either list means the same thing.
     *
     * ### Why not `@Metadata`
     *
     * `KmFunction` has an annotations list, but `kotlin-metadata-jvm` only populates it when the
     * compiler was asked to keep annotations in metadata, which Compose's release build was not.
     * The class file is the fact here; metadata is how the *parameters* are then interpreted.
     *
     * Two consumers: the name rule above, and [composableCandidate], which is what stops the arity
     * check from declining every composable.

     * A `@Composable`, bound as an ordinary function whose `$composer`, `$changed` and `$default`
     * slots are Python's to fill.
     *
     * ### Why the synthetic parameters are exposed rather than hidden
     *
     * `docs/pythonx-adapter-design.md` §4.5 rejected every way of *hiding* them, and each rejection
     * still stands: an arity-prefix entry cannot express "pass `text`, skip `modifier`", presence
     * branching costs 2^15 call expressions for `Text`, `Text$default` does not exist, and a
     * generated wrapper cannot restate defaults metadata never carries. What none of those noticed is
     * that the mask is a **declared trailing parameter** (§5.2) -- so it does not have to be a
     * compile-time constant at all. Compute it at run time and every one of those problems is
     * somebody else's: `$default` bit *i* set means "parameter *i* was not passed, substitute its
     * default", which is a fact about one integer rather than about 2^15 branches.
     *
     * Where that integer is computed matters and is not here. `pythonx` calls `androidx`, never the
     * other way round, so the mask is Python's arithmetic over which arguments the caller wrote;
     * this layer's job is to leave a slot for it. `$composer` is the one value Python cannot invent
     * -- it exists only inside a composition -- and comes from the single hand-written entry point.
     *
     * ### An extension composable, and the numbering that used to be guessed at
     *
     * This used to decline one outright, on the stated grounds that "Compose's `$changed` slots count
     * receivers and its `$default` bits are assigned over value parameters, so a receiver shifts one
     * numbering and not the other. Nothing here has measured which." It is measured now, out of the
     * callee, the way `docs/pythonx-adapter-design.md` §5.2 measured the mask in the first place --
     * `javap -c androidx/compose/material3/NavigationBarKt`, whose `NavigationBarItem` is
     * `RowScope.NavigationBarItem(selected, onClick, icon, modifier = …, …)`:
     *
     *     iload $default; ldc -2147483648; iand; ifeq …   ; aload_0 -- the RowScope
     *     iload $default; iconst_1;         iand; ifeq …  ; iload_1 -- `selected`
     *     …
     *     iload $default; bipush 8; iand; ifeq +11
     *     getstatic androidx/compose/ui/Modifier.Companion
     *     astore 4                                        ; `modifier`, JVM local 4
     *
     * Both halves of the guess are answered, and they answer differently:
     *
     * | | does the receiver shift it |
     * |---|---|
     * | `$changed` | **yes** -- the receiver is slot 0, so value parameter *i* occupies bits `3(i+1)`…`3(i+1)+2` |
     * | `$default` | **no** -- bit *i* is value parameter *i*; `modifier` is the 4th value parameter and is guarded by `& 8` |
     *
     * The receiver is not left out of `$default` altogether: it is given **bit 31**, the top bit of
     * the first word, which is what `& -2147483648` above is. It is never set by a caller -- a
     * receiver cannot be omitted -- so it costs this binding nothing, and the same encoding appears
     * on `SegmentedButton` (two `$changed` words, `MultiChoiceSegmentedButtonRowScope` receiver).
     *
     * Only the `$default` answer is load-bearing here, because `pythonx` passes `$changed` as `0`
     * unconditionally (it is a claim about staticness that this caller cannot make); so the whole of
     * what an extension composable needed was for the mask arithmetic to count value parameters
     * rather than slots. `ComposableShape` was already right: `changedCountFor` is computed from
     * `allParameterTypes.size`, which **includes** the receiver, which is what the `$changed`
     * numbering does.
     *
     * ### What is still declined here, and why
     *
     * - **A shape [ComposableShape.of] does not recognise**, which then falls back to the decline
     *   this method was reached from. A future lowering that adds a fourth kind of synthetic
     *   parameter degrades to "not bound" rather than to a call with the wrong arguments.
     * - **A `char` parameter**, for `boundaryTypeOf`'s reason: Python has no character type.
     * - **A composable with more than 31 value parameters *and* a receiver**, which would need the
     *   receiver's bit 31 and a 32nd value parameter's bit 31 at once. `ComposableShape` predicts two
     *   `$default` words there and Compose would emit one, so the shape check declines it rather than
     *   writing a mask into a slot that does not exist. Nothing measured declares one -- the widest
     *   composable in three jars takes 17.

     * The name a **function-typed** parameter of a composable is reported under, or `null` when this
     * is not one and the declared name should stand.
     *
     * ### Why the declared name alone is not enough
     *
     * `androidx.compose.foundation.layout.Column` declares
     * `content: @Composable ColumnScope.() -> Unit`, which `@Metadata` records as `kotlin.Function1`
     * -- an extension function type over `ColumnScope`. Its JVM descriptor is
     * `Lkotlin/jvm/functions/Function3;`, because the Compose plugin appends a `Composer` and one
     * `$changed` to a composable function *type* exactly as it appends them to a composable
     * function. `androidx.compose.material3.Button` declares `onClick: () -> Unit`, which is
     * `kotlin.Function0` in **both**.
     *
     * `pythonx` has to hand Kotlin an object implementing the right interface, so it needs the
     * compiled arity; and it has to know whether to thread a composer through the invocation, so it
     * needs to know which of the two cases this is. Both are answered by comparing the two arities
     * the walker already has, and neither is guessed:
     *
     * | | declared | compiled | reported |
     * |---|---|---|---|
     * | `Button.onClick` | `Function0` | `Function0` | `kotlin.Function0()->kotlin.Unit` |
     * | `Column.content` | `Function1` | `Function3` | `kotlin.Function3@Composable(…ColumnScope)->kotlin.Unit` |
     * | `Slider.onValueChange` | `Function1` | `Function1` | `kotlin.Function1(kotlin.Float)->kotlin.Unit` |
     *
     * ### Why the compiled arity is not the whole answer
     *
     * It was, for as long as the only thing a Python callable could be was a `content` that takes
     * nothing. Two arities say *which interface* to implement and *whether a composer is threaded*,
     * and say nothing at all about **what to do with the arguments that interface is invoked with**.
     * `Column.content`'s `Function3` and `Slider.onValueChange`'s `Function1` both have arguments to
     * forward, and forwarding one needs two facts the arity cannot carry:
     *
     * - **whether it is a value or a Kotlin object.** A `Float` reaches Python as a number and a
     *   `ColumnScope` as a proxy over a handle; the erased `invoke(Object)` makes them the same
     *   thing at the call site, and only the declared type argument tells them apart. This is why
     *   the receiver of a scoped content could not be forwarded before -- not a different problem
     *   from `(Float) -> Unit`, the *same* one.
     * - **what Kotlin type the proxy is over**, which is what `_BY_RECEIVER` is keyed on and
     *   therefore the whole of whether `ColumnScope`'s extensions are reachable from the value.
     *
     * The **return** type is here for the opposite reason: so that a slot whose lambda has to give
     * something back keeps being refused. `Function1` is the spelling of both `(Float) -> Unit` and
     * `(Float) -> Boolean`, and the second cannot be bound -- `TypeTag` has one `INT` for `Byte`
     * through `Long` and one `FLOAT` for both floating widths, so nothing here can say which boxed
     * type the caller will cast the answer to. 19 of the 560 function-typed slots three Compose jars
     * declare return something other than `Unit` (`ComposableBindingTest.functionTypedSlotsCarry…`);
     * without the return type in the name they would be indistinguishable from the 541 that do, and
     * would fail as a `ClassCastException` inside Compose rather than as a refusal at the call.
     *
     * ### Why the answer travels in the type name
     *
     * The same reason `$composer` travels in the *parameter* name: `ExposedCallable` already carries
     * a per-slot declared type name to every target, and a column that only composables use would be
     * a second thing that can disagree with the first. Neither `@` nor `(` nor `>` is a character a
     * Kotlin fully-qualified name can contain, so nothing legitimate can collide with the grammar,
     * and `pythonx._function_slot` is the single reader.
     *
     * Anything the walker cannot fully describe returns `null`, so the slot keeps its bare declared
     * name and `pythonx` declines it as an ordinary object handle rather than casting a wrapper to an
     * interface it does not implement. That covers an arity relationship neither rule predicts, and
     * also a type argument with no classifier -- `SwipeableKt.rememberSwipeableState`'s
     * `(T) -> Boolean` is the one such slot in the three jars, and a type *parameter* has no name a
     * proxy could be built over.

     * `FunctionN` from it. What is **not** shared is how a slot's type reaches a call:

     * | `@Composable` | [generateThunkClass]'s bytecode | erased -- a `CHECKCAST` to `kotlin/jvm/functions/FunctionN` needs no Kotlin name |
     * | everything else | generated Kotlin source | **spellable** -- `args[i] as (Float) -> Unit` |
     *
     * So the composable path never asked `resolveKotlinType` about a function type and this one did,
     * and got the only answer that function can give: `objectBoundaryTypeOrNull` requires the
     * classifier to exist as a public class file, and Kotlin's built-in `FunctionN` has none anywhere
     * -- they live in `.kotlin_builtins`. 44 of the 46 declined public top-level `Modifier`
     * extensions declined for exactly that (`ArtifactScannerTest`), `clickable` among them.
     *
     * `objectBoundaryTypeOrNull` is deliberately **not** widened. Its rule is right for what it can
     * see: a classifier with no class file is one generated source must not name, and it has no
     * access to the JVM descriptor that says a `kotlin.Function1` slot is compiled as `Function1`
     * rather than as a lowered `Function3`. The exception is opted into here, by the one caller that
     * holds both facts.
     *
     * ### What stays declined
     *
     * - **`suspend`.** `Modifier.pointerInput(block: suspend PointerInputScope.() -> Unit)` records
     *   its type as `Function2<PointerInputScope, Continuation<Unit>, Any?>`, which [functionSlotTypeName]
     *   describes perfectly well -- and Kotlin will not let generated source assign a `Function2` to a
     *   `suspend` function type, nor can a Python callable answer `COROUTINE_SUSPENDED`. It is a
     *   *different* limit from the one this method opens, which is why it is named rather than left
     *   to fail as a compile error in somebody's generated fragment.
     * - **`@Composable`, inside a declaration that is not.** `Modifier.composed(factory:)` is the
     *   case. The fragment is compiled without the Compose plugin (`:ksp-fixtures:artifact`'s
     *   `build.gradle.kts` says so, and it is the whole shape of that fixture's claim), so
     *   `@Composable Modifier.() -> Modifier` written there is an ordinary `Function1` while the slot
     *   is a lowered `Function3`. **This one does not fail as a compile error**, which is why it is
     *   declined by name rather than left to the compiler: removing this guard and asking for
     *   `androidx.compose.ui.ComposedModifierKt` produces a fragment that compiles, casting
     *   `args[2] as kotlin.Function1<Modifier, Modifier>` beside a slot reported as
     *   `kotlin.Function3@Composable(…)->…` -- so `pythonx` would build a `Function3` from the name and
     *   hand it to a `Function1` call site, and the disagreement would surface inside Compose. The
     *   thunk path has no such problem, which is why a composable *declaration* binds these and a
     *   non-composable one cannot.
     * - **anything [renderKotlinFunctionType] cannot write**, which is a type argument that is a type
     *   *parameter* or a star projection (`Modifier.swipeable`'s `thresholds`), a use-site variance
     *   this walker will not reproduce, or a classifier that is not a nameable public class.
     *
     * A slot returning something other than `kotlin.Unit` is **not** declined here, and that is the
     * same judgement `a179b747` made for composables rather than a new one: the return type is in the
     * name precisely so that `pythonx._coerce` can refuse to fill it *with a reason* -- `TypeTag`
     * carries one `INT` for `Byte` through `Long`, so neither side can say which boxed type the callee
     * will cast the erased answer to. Binding the declaration around it costs nothing and buys a
     * caller of `Modifier.onKeyEvent` a message about the slot instead of an `AttributeError` about

     * **The wall `ebe3365f` pinned**: the same walker typed `Color` two ways, and a `@Composable`'s
     * `Color` slot refused the very handle an ordinary declaration accepted.
     *
     * ### The two views, and why there were two
     *
     * An ordinary declaration is typed by [resolveKotlinType] from `@Metadata`, which knows `Color`
     * is a `@JvmInline value class` over a `ULong` whose own constructor is `internal` -- so it can
     * neither be built from a raw number nor unwrapped, and crosses as an object handle. A
     * composable's parameters were typed by [composableSlotTagOf] from the **JVM descriptor**, where
     * the same `Color` is the letter `J`. `INT` and `OBJECT` for one type, in one jar.
     *
     * The descriptor is not gratuitous. A composable's `$composer`, `$changed` and `$default` slots
     * are added by the Compose plugin during IR lowering and are **not declared anywhere in
     * metadata**, so the JVM parameter list is genuinely longer than the Kotlin one and only the
     * descriptor can say what the trailing slots are. What did not follow -- and was the defect -- is
     * that the *declared* slots had to be read from it too.
     *
     * ### How the two lists are paired
     *
     * Positionally, over the first [ComposableShape.declaredCount] JVM parameters, and that is a
     * *checked* relation rather than an assumption: [ComposableShape.of] has already established
     * that JVM parameter `declaredCount` is the `Composer` and that every parameter after it is an
     * `int`, and [composableCandidate] additionally requires `shape.totalCount` to equal the JVM
     * parameter count. Two arities, related in exactly one admissible way -- the same argument
     * [functionSlotTypeName] makes for a function-typed slot, where a declared `Function1` may be a
     * compiled `Function1` or a compiled `Function3` and nothing else.
     *
     * ### And what stops a wrong pairing from being silent
     *
     * The arity relation says the lists are the same length; it cannot say that slot *i* of one is
     * slot *i* of the other. So every pair is **cross-checked** here, and there are only three ways
     * for a pair to be admitted:
     *
     * | the two views | what it means | what happens |
     * |---|---|---|
     * | the same tag | a primitive against its own descriptor, an object against a reference, a `Dp` (`FLOAT`) against an `F` | bound, unchanged |
     * | metadata says `OBJECT`, and the carrier's own `unbox-impl` returns **exactly** this descriptor | a value class the walker cannot open, erased into the slot | bound as a handle, and the thunk unwraps it |
     * | metadata resolves to nothing at all | a nullable primitive, a built-in with no class file, a function type | the descriptor's answer stands, which is what shipped before |
     *
     * Anything else -- a `Modifier` against a `J`, a `Color` against a `Ljava/lang/String;` -- returns
     * `null` and **declines the whole declaration**. It cannot be bound to "whichever view was
     * consulted last", because that is precisely the failure this method exists to remove.
     *
     * `ComposableValueClassSlotTest.everyComposableSlotAgreesBetweenMetadataAndDescriptorWhenPairedInOrder`
     * measures that no composable in three Compose jars is declined by that rule, and its sibling
     * shifts the pairing by one slot to show the rule is not vacuous.

     *
     * A branch that writes the arguments *W* is refused when **any sibling overload of the same
     * Kotlin name would also accept exactly *W***: same receiver, a parameter of the same name and
     * declared type for every member of *W*, and a default on everything else it declares. That is
     * the shape Kotlin reports as `Overload resolution ambiguity`, and the generated call has no way
     * to break the tie -- there are no arguments left to type-annotate, which is exactly why the tie
     * exists.
     *
     * Deliberately **not** a model of Kotlin's specificity rules. Kotlin does resolve some of these
     * (it prefers the two-`Dp` `padding` over the four-`Dp` one when nothing is written, on parameter
     * count), and reproducing that here would mean a generated call silently binding to a *different
     * declaration* than the table entry names. Refusing the branch instead costs one spelling --
     * `padding__Dp_Dp()` with no arguments -- and buys that every branch calls the declaration its
     * entry is named after.
     *
     * ### What a refused branch becomes
     *
     * Not a missing branch: `pythonx` reads `paramHasDefault` per slot and cannot express "these two
     * but not both at once", so the call is reachable and has to answer for itself. It throws, naming
     * the declaration and saying what to write, which is the same answer
     * [disambiguateOverloads] gives one level up for the same reason.
