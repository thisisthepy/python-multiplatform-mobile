/**
 * `docs/pythonx-adapter-design.md` §4.5 closed for everything the walker actually binds: a Kotlin
 * default value is reached by **not writing the argument**, in generated Kotlin *source*.
 *
 * ### What the problem was
 *
 * §4.5 measures it: `material3.Text` declares 16--18 parameters of which **one** is required,
 * `Button` 10 of which two are, and across the `Modifier` surface **254 of 435 parameters (58%)
 * declare a default**. Every generated body passed every argument, so a Python caller had to supply
 * all of them -- and the values it would have had to supply (`TextStyle.Default`, `Alignment.Center`)
 * are objects the type gate does not bind, so it could not have supplied them at all. "Pass
 * everything" is not merely inconvenient; for most of the bound surface it is impossible.
 *
 * ### Why the answer is in the generated Kotlin and not in the table
 *
 * §4.5 lists four candidates. Three are closed:
 *
 * | candidate | what closes it |
 * |---|---|
 * | one entry per **arity prefix** | cannot express "skip the middle one", which is how Compose is written -- and it multiplies table keys, each of which `PythonProxySource` publishes by leaf name |
 * | the compiler's **`$default` synthetic** | `ACC_SYNTHETIC`, so Kotlin source cannot name it; and `javap -p` over `ButtonKt` shows no `Button$default` exists at all |
 * | a **generated wrapper restating the defaults** | metadata carries the *flag*, never the value |
 *
 * The fourth -- **presence branching in the generated lambda** -- is the one that survives, and its
 * stated objection ("2^15 branches for `Text`") is an objection to an *unbounded* version of it.
 * `Text` is a `@Composable` and no composable is in the table at all (the arity check in
 * [ArtifactScanner] declines every one of them for its synthetic `$composer`/`$changed`
 * parameters). Measured over everything the walker does bind today -- all of
 * `foundation-layout-desktop-1.6.11`, `kotlin-stdlib`'s `kotlin.text` and JUnit 4 --
 * **the widest declaration declares four defaults**, so the exponent is 4 and the branch count is
 * 16. [MAX_OMITTABLE_PARAMETERS] is what keeps it that way for an artefact nobody has measured yet.
 *
 * ### The sentinel, and why one exists at all
 *
 * A branch tests `args[i] == null`. That works because the boundary already carries `null` for every
 * tag: `UpcallTrampoline.toKotlin` opens with *"`None` is how Python spells a null argument, whatever
 * the tag says it should have been"*, before it ever looks at the tag. So no new marshalling
 * category, no change to `ExposedCallable`, and no change to any of the five bootstraps.
 *
 * It also cannot collide with a real value in the primitive cases, which is the thing worth pinning:
 * `resolveKotlinType` **declines a nullable primitive and a nullable value class outright** (a `null`
 * arriving for an `Int?` would throw inside `(args[0] as Long)`), so a `FLOAT`/`INT`/`BOOLEAN` slot
 * can never legitimately be `null`. The one case where the sentinel is not free is a **nullable
 * object** parameter that declares a default: `None` there means "omitted" and can no longer mean
 * "null". That is stated in [ArtifactScanner]'s KDoc rather than worked around.
