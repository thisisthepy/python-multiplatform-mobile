/**
 * **Where the inheritance relation comes from**, and what carrying it costs the table.
 *
 * `ebe3365f` pinned the second wall: `pythonx._coerce` compared an owned value's declared type name
 * against the slot's for **equality**, so `BitmapPainter(...)` was refused where a `Painter` was
 * wanted, and every `Painter` in Compose was out of reach except the one function that happens to
 * declare the base type.
 *
 * ### The relation is the walker's to answer, and only the walker's
 *
 * `pythonx` holds names. A handle is an integer, `TypeTag.OBJECT` says nothing about what it points
 * at, and there is no reflection shared by five targets to ask -- agent-rules §12 retires dynamic
 * binding for exactly that reason. The walker, on the other hand, has the class files open: a
 * supertype is `ClassNode.superName` and `ClassNode.interfaces`, one already-cached read per link.
 *
 * ### Which direction is carried, and why that is the cheap one
 *
 * The **value's** ancestry, not the slot's subtypes. A `Painter` slot accepts every `Painter` that
 * will ever exist, which is not knowable from one walk; a produced value has one finite chain. So
 * the question is asked once per declared *return type that crosses as a handle*, and nowhere else.
 *
 * ### And what it costs
 *
 * Measured rather than asserted to be small: see
 * [theAncestryTheTableCarriesIsMeasuredRatherThanAssumed], which prints the number of entries that
 * gain anything, the characters added, and the longest chain.
