/**
 * The layer `a179b747` left closed: a function-typed parameter of a declaration that is **not** a
 * `@Composable`.
 *
 * ### What was in the way
 *
 * That commit taught the slot *name* to carry a whole signature, and taught `pythonx` to build a
 * `FunctionN` from a Python callable out of it. Both of those are shared by every producer. What was
 * not shared is how the two producers reach a parameter's type at all:
 *
 * | | how the slot's type is turned into a call |
 * |---|---|
 * | `@Composable` | [ComposableThunks] emits bytecode; a `CHECKCAST` to `kotlin/jvm/functions/FunctionN` needs no Kotlin name |
 * | everything else | generated **Kotlin source** casts `args[i]` to the declared type, so the type has to be *spellable* |
 *
 * `resolveKotlinType` -> `objectBoundaryTypeOrNull` answers "not spellable" for `kotlin.Function0`,
 * and it is right to: it looks the classifier up as a public class file, and Kotlin's built-in
 * function types have none anywhere -- they live in `.kotlin_builtins` metadata. So the parameter
 * was declined one layer before the slot grammar was ever consulted, and
 * `ArtifactScannerTest.composeModifierExtensionsSurviveBothGates` counted the cost: **44 of the 46
 * declined public top-level `Modifier` extensions declined for exactly that**, `clickable` and
 * `combinedClickable` among them.
 *
 * ### What opens it
 *
 * [ArtifactScanner.candidateFromFunction] now consults the same slot grammar
 * [ArtifactScanner.functionSlotTypeName] the composable path uses, and -- when it can also *write*
 * the Kotlin type -- supplies its own `OBJECT` boundary type rather than asking
 * `resolveKotlinType` for one. `objectBoundaryTypeOrNull` is untouched, so nothing else that has no
 * class file became bindable; the walker opted this one case in at the point it knows the JVM
 * descriptor, which is the fact the grammar needs and the type resolver never had.
 *
 * ### What still declines, and why it is not an omission
 *
 * | shape | example | why |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `suspend` lambda | `Modifier.pointerInput(block:)` | its compiled type takes a `Continuation` and answers `COROUTINE_SUSPENDED`; a Python callable cannot be one, and Kotlin refuses to assign a `Function2` to a `suspend` function type at all |
 * | `@Composable` lambda inside a non-composable | `Modifier.composed(factory:)` | the generated fragment is compiled **without** the Compose plugin, so `@Composable () -> Unit` there is a `Function0` while the callee wants the lowered `Function3` |
 * | a type argument with no name | `Modifier.swipeable`'s `thresholds` | a type *parameter* has no spelling, which is the same reason the composable path returns `null` for it |
 *
 * A slot returning something other than `kotlin.Unit` is **not** in that table: it binds, carries its
 * return type in the name, and `pythonx._coerce` refuses to fill it with a message. That is
 * `a179b747`'s judgement and it is unchanged here -- and it is the same judgement for a
 * non-composable, for the same reason: `TypeTag` carries one `INT` for `Byte` through `Long`, so
 * neither side can say which boxed type the callee will cast the erased answer to. What differs is
 * only that the declaration around it is reachable, so a caller who wanted `onKeyEvent`'s *other*
 * arguments gets a refusal naming the slot instead of an `AttributeError` naming nothing.
