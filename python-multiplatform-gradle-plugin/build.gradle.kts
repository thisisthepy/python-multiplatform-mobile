    // The artefact walker (`docs/ecosystem.md` §5b's second producer) reads compiled class files
    // out of the jars the build resolves. ASM is a *plugin* dependency and deliberately not a
    // library one: nothing at runtime reads bytecode, and the walk happens once, at build time.
    //
    // Gradle bundles ASM, but under `org.gradle.internal.impldep.org.objectweb.asm` -- a relocated
    // internal package with no compatibility promise -- so this is a real coordinate rather than a
    // reach into Gradle's own copy.
    asmCoordinates.forEach { implementation(it) }

    // `KlibScanner`'s reader: `org.jetbrains.kotlin.library.abi.LibraryAbiReader`, which decodes a
    // `.klib`'s ABI protobuf into Kotlin-typed declarations. A klib is what a Kotlin/Native target
    // resolves where a JVM target resolves a jar, so this is to `KlibScanner` exactly what ASM plus

    // reason both of those are: the walk happens once, at build time, and nothing this plugin emits
    // into a consumer's build re-reads a klib at run time.
    //
    // **It is 55.6 MiB (58,251,465 bytes), by far the largest thing on this classpath, so where that
    // lands was measured rather than assumed:**
    //   - not in the library. `python-multiplatform` does not depend on this plugin;
    //     `:python-multiplatform:dependencies` reports `kotlin-compiler-embeddable:2.0.20` in no
    //     configuration at all, `desktopRuntimeClasspath` included.
    //   - not on a consumer's *application* classpath. `:ksp-fixtures:app:dependencies` reports zero
    //     occurrences of `2.0.20`. (It does report `kotlin-compiler-embeddable:2.4.0` and
    //     `2.4.20-Beta2` under `kotlinCompilerPluginClasspath*` and the commonizer's configurations
    //     -- KGP's own, present before this dependency existed.)
    //   - it *was* on a consumer's **buildscript** classpath, and that is exactly what broke them:
    //     `implementation` becomes `runtime` scope in this plugin's published POM (checked in the
    //     generated `pom-default.xml`), so applying the plugin put a second copy of
    //     `org.jetbrains.kotlin.build.report.metrics.*` on the plugin classloader beside the Kotlin
    //     Gradle Plugin's own, and KGP could no longer decorate `KotlinCompile` -- `./gradlew tasks`
    //     failed outright in all three external consumer projects. `compileOnly` is what keeps it out
    //     of the POM; `verifyPluginRuntimeClasspath` (bottom of this file) is what keeps it out.
    //
    // Gradle 8.11.1 ships a byte-identical copy in its own `lib/` (same SHA-256), but plugin
    // classloaders see a filtered view of Gradle's runtime -- `org.gradle.*` API packages, not
    // `org.jetbrains.kotlin.library.abi` -- so this is a real coordinate rather than a reach into
    // Gradle's own copy, for the same reason the ASM lines above are.
    //
    // ### Does not survive a consumer's classloader hierarchy called directly -- fixed with isolation
    //
    // Called from `PythonArtifactBindingsTask`'s/`PythonStubsTask`'s own classloader,
    // `KlibScanner.scanKlib` fails at execution with `NoSuchMethodError:
    // KotlinLibraryImplKt.createKotlinLibrary$default(...)`. Not a version conflict Gradle could
    // resolve -- `buildEnvironment` reports this coordinate at 2.0.20 on that project's plugin
    // classpath, correctly. It is **class mixing across classloader scopes**, measured by printing
    // each class's `CodeSource` from inside the task:
    //
    //     org.jetbrains.kotlin.library.abi.LibraryAbiReader                 <- 2.0.20, this jar
    //     org.jetbrains.kotlin.library.ToolingSingleFileKlibResolveStrategy <- 2.0.20, this jar
    //     org.jetbrains.kotlin.library.impl.KotlinLibraryImplKt             <- kotlin-util-klib 2.4.20-Beta2
    //     org.jetbrains.kotlin.konan.file.ZipFileSystemAccessor             <- kotlin-util-io 2.4.20-Beta2
    //
    // The last two come from the **root project's** buildscript scope, which the Kotlin Gradle Plugin
    // populates and which is a *parent* of every subproject's plugin classloader. Parent-first
    // delegation hands out `kotlin-util-klib`'s half of `org.jetbrains.kotlin.library.*` at KGP's
    // version and this jar's half at 2.0.20, and the halves do not fit. Any consumer that declares
    // KGP in its root `plugins {}` block reproduces it.
    //
    // Aligning the version does not fix it -- tried both ways:
    //   - `2.4.20-Beta2` alone does not compile: Gradle's embedded Kotlin is 2.0.20 and that jar's
    //     modules carry metadata 2.2.0-2.4.0 ("expected version is 2.0.0").
    //   - with `-Xskip-metadata-version-check` it compiles and gets further, then fails with
    //     `NoClassDefFoundError: org/jetbrains/kotlin/protobuf/Internal$EnumLite` -- the parent's
    //     `kotlin-util-klib` needs the protobuf runtime shaded *inside this jar*, in the child scope
    //     it cannot see. The mixing is symmetric; neither version wins.
    //
    // **Fixed with real isolation**: `KlibScanWorkAction`
    // (`python-multiplatform-gradle-plugin/src/main/kotlin/python/multiplatform/gradle/artifact
    // /KlibScanWorkAction.kt`) runs every `KlibScanner` call behind a `WorkerExecutor`
    // `classLoaderIsolation` whose explicit classpath is this plugin's own classloader's `.urLs` --
    // the child scope only, none of the root buildscript scope above it. An isolated worker
    // classloader's parent is Gradle's own minimal worker infrastructure, not that root scope, so
    // `org.jetbrains.kotlin.library.*` has exactly one source inside the worker. Confirmed against a
    // real consumer build, not only this plugin's own unit tests:
    // `:ksp-fixtures:klib-artifact:generatePythonArtifactBindings` and `:generatePythonStubs` both
    // pass and emit the walker's real output (`kotlinx.coroutines.flow.internal.checkIndexOverflow`).
    //
    // ### Compile-only here, resolved by the consumer at klib-walking time
    //
    // `KlibScanner` is the only file in this plugin that names a type from this jar, and it only ever
    // runs inside `KlibScanWorkAction`'s isolated worker -- which builds its classloader from an
    // *explicit* classpath, not from this one. So the reader has to be **compilable** here and
    // **present in the worker**, and those are two different classpaths. Nothing needs it on the
    // plugin's own runtime classpath in between, and the block above is the price of putting it there.
    //
    // The worker's copy arrives instead through a resolvable configuration the *consumer's* project
    // owns: `PythonBindingsPlugin` creates a detached configuration for `DEFAULT_KLIB_READER_COORDINATES`
    // and hands it to `PythonArtifactBindingsTask`/`PythonStubsTask` as `klibReaderClasspath`, which
    // `scanKlibIsolated` appends to the worker classpath. It is resolved lazily -- a build that walks
    // only jars never downloads it -- and pinned, so a consumer's own Kotlin version cannot move it.
    //
    // Pinned to 2.0.20 for the reason the `kotlin-metadata-jvm` comment below spells out, and that
    // pin is also the version floor `KlibScanner`'s KDoc measures its extension-receiver decline
    // against.
    compileOnly(klibReaderCoordinates)
    // `KlibScannerTest` calls `KlibScanner` in-process, in the test JVM, where there is no worker to
    // hand a classpath to. The test runtime is not published and not a consumer classpath, so this is
    // the one place the reader may still be an ordinary dependency.
    testImplementation(klibReaderCoordinates)

    // Reads `@Metadata`'s `d1`/`d2` payload -- the facts ASM's view of a class file cannot reach:
    // a multi-file facade's part classes, an extension function's receiver, a value class's
    // underlying type and accessor, `suspend`. See `ArtifactScanner`'s KDoc. Also a *plugin*
    // dependency, for the same reason ASM is: the walk happens once, at build time, and nothing
    // this plugin emits into a consumer's own build re-reads bytecode at runtime.
    //
    // Pinned to "2.0.20" rather than `libs.versions.kotlin` (2.4.20-Beta2): this module's own
    // `compileKotlin` runs on Gradle's *embedded* Kotlin compiler (2.0.20 on Gradle 8.11.1, see the
    // `kotlin-dsl` comment above), which cannot read a dependency whose own metadata a newer
    // compiler wrote -- "the actual metadata version is 2.4.0, but the compiler version 2.0.0 can
    // read versions up to 2.1.0". The library's own read/write logic tolerates a wide range of
    // *target* metadata versions regardless of which release of the library does the reading, so an
    // older `kotlin-metadata-jvm` reading androidx's or kotlin-stdlib's newer-than-2.0.20 metadata is
    // not the same constraint -- see `ArtifactScannerTest`'s real-jar cases, which this version reads
