/**
 * Resolve once, invoke many. Both handles are computed here and live on in `__main__`, so every
 * call afterwards passes an integer and never a string again -- which is the whole argument of
 * `docs/upcall-design.md` (a selector is fast because it is interned, not because a table
 * exists).
 *
 * `ctypes` stands in for the generated proxy type a finished binder would install. Two stub
 * shapes are in play and the difference is the point:
 *
 * - `(long) -> long` reaches zero-argument entries and carries nothing but the handle. That is
 *   all this demo could do before ROADMAP §13. Bound as `_pm_invoke0`, because the *other* one
 *   has to be called `_pm_invoke`: that is the name
 *   [python.multiplatform.ffi.upcall.PythonProxySource] generates its calls against, and its
 *   entry-point guard refuses to install a proxy module without it.
 * - `(long, PyObject *) -> PyObject *` is the argument-carrying trampoline. It is the shape a
 *   `PyCFunction` slot takes, so the same stub serves the proxy type when that lands.
 *
 * `_pm_release` and `_pm_cancel` are bound for a reason that has nothing to do with the raw calls
 * below: `PythonProxySource`'s `_pm_watch` checks for both before it will arm a cancellation
 * notice on a `Future`, and a host that has not bound them gets cancellation observed at
 * completion instead of at `Future.cancel()`. They cost one `CFUNCTYPE` each and no new stub
 * shape -- `(long) -> int` is already built for `tp_clear`.
 *
 * `internal` rather than `private` because `UpcallDemo.desktop.kt` next door calls it, and
 * `internal` rather than `public` because a `public` top-level function in this module would be
 * scanned into the generated table -- exposure is a blacklist here.

 * `await` over a `suspend fun` that really suspends.
 *
 * The Kotlin body of [Greeter.greetLater] parks its continuation, so the boundary has nothing to
 * hand back and returns an `asyncio.Future` instead; the `await` in the generated `async def`
 * resolves once a **Kotlin thread** resumes the continuation and the completion settles that
 * Future. Which is why this cannot be `commonMain`: the resumption has to come from a thread the
 * interpreter is not running on, or the demo silently takes the fast path and proves nothing.
 *
 * The completer waits for a `Future` to have been constructed before it resumes, for the reason
 * `python-multiplatform`'s own `AsyncUpcallDeliveryTest` records: resuming while `AsyncUpcall`
 * is still deciding what to return makes `PendingCall.isDone` true early, the value is handed back
 * directly, and the run exercises the path it was written to avoid.
 *
 * Every touch of Kotlin state from the completer is inside [withGIL]. That is not decoration:
 * `commonMain/README.md` names the GIL as the barrier that makes the boundary's non-synchronised
 * fields visible across threads, and this thread is one CPython has never seen.
