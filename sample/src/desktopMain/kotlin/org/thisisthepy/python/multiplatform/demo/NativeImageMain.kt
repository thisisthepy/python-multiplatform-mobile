 * A headless entry point for the GraalVM native-image build path. `main.kt`'s `fun main() =
 * application { ... }` requires a running AWT/Compose window, which is not what this build path
 * is verifying -- it is verifying that Python can resolve a Kotlin declaration by name and call
 * it, inside a closed-world binary. Kept separate so a Compose window is never a precondition
 * for that question.
 *
 * The table this resolves against is **generated**: [installGeneratedUpcallTable] installs
 * `python.multiplatform.generated.FunctionTable`, which `python-multiplatform-ksp` emitted from
 * `ExposedToPython.kt` because `build.gradle.kts` applies the bindings plugin. This file used to
 * carry a hand-written `FunctionTableFragment` with a comment saying the generator did not exist
 * yet; a hand-written fragment keeps passing whether or not KSP ran at all, so what the
 * native-image check measured was narrower than what it appeared to measure.
 *
 * [DemoCounter.press] is called [PRESSES] times first, so the number Python reads back is one
 * this process produced rather than a constant a stub could also have returned.

/**
 * The second half: the *generated Python proxy module* inside the same closed-world binary.
 *
 * Everything above reaches the boundary the way a test harness does -- a name to a handle, a handle
 * to a tuple. What a user writes instead is `Greeter('x').greet(2)`, and that goes through Python
 * source `PythonProxySource.render` produces at run time and `exec`s. That is the part with a
 * native-image question attached, and it is not the obvious one: the source is generated from a
 * table that is already statically emitted, so no reflection is reintroduced. What *is* new here is
 * `_pm_release` and `_pm_cancel` -- two more Panama upcall stub shapes than the first half binds --
 * plus `asyncio`, a thread, and `PyMethodDef`-free `ctypes` callbacks fired from the interpreter.
 * A missing descriptor in `reachability-metadata.json` shows up at the first call as
 * `MissingForeignRegistrationError` and never at build time, which is why this runs rather than
 * merely compiling.
 *
 * Each check is asserted in Kotlin rather than in the script, because the reports are strings the
 * demo screen also shows: one place decides what "correct" is.
