/**
 * `./gradlew :sample:run`.
 *
 * The interpreter comes up before the window because every section of the screen reads from it;
 * `build.gradle.kts` gives this task the `PYTHONHOME` that `Py_Initialize` needs to find a
 * stdlib, and the same prefix is where `manager.loadLibPython` finds `libpython` when the library
 * is on the classpath as class directories rather than as `desktopJar`.
 *
 * This used to be a page of raw `PyLong_FromLongLong` / `PyRun_SimpleString` calls, including a
 * pointer round-tripped through a `Double`. None of that is how the library is meant to be used
 * any more, and one of those calls (`PyRun_SimpleString`) swallows the error indicator, which is
 * exactly what `Python3.exec` exists to avoid.
