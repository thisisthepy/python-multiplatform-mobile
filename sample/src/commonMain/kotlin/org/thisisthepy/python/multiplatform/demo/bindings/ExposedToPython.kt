 * generated `python.multiplatform.generated.FunctionTable`, which [installGeneratedUpcallTable]
 * hands to [python.multiplatform.reflection.UpcallTable]. Exposure is a blacklist (ROADMAP §7,
 * `docs/binding-policy.md`): being `public` is all it takes, and opting *out* is what needs an
 * annotation.
 *
 * The Python-visible name of an entry is its Kotlin qualified name, which is why

/**
 * An ordinary Kotlin `class` -- constructor, instance methods, instance properties, a companion,

 *
 * [DemoCounter] above is an `object`, so every entry KSP emits for it is receiver-free and lands as
 * a plain module function. That is the *only* shape this sample used to exercise. Everything the
 * boundary grew after it -- `CONSTRUCTOR`/`METHOD`/`GETTER`/`SETTER` entries, a metaclass carrying
 * the companion, and `await` over a `suspend fun` -- needs a real class to have anything to attach
 * to, and none of it had a caller outside `python-multiplatform`'s own tests until this type
 * existed.
 *
 * Each member is here for a specific rule the Python surface has to reproduce:
 *
 * | member | what it pins |
 * |---|---|
 * | `Greeter(subject)` | a Python `__init__` that calls Kotlin's constructor and holds the receiver handle |
 * | [greet] | an instance method, receiver passed as `args[0]` |
 * | [subject] | a `var` -- readable *and* assignable from Python |
 * | [greetings] | a `var` with `private set` -- readable, and assignment must raise `AttributeError` |
 * | [Companion.PUNCTUATION] | a companion `val` -- reachable through the class, never through an instance, and not assignable |
 * | [Companion.built] | a companion `var` -- the same, plus assignment reaching Kotlin |
 * | [Companion.forget] | a companion *function*, which lands on the metaclass beside the properties |
 * | [greetNow] | a `suspend fun` that never suspends: `await` must take the fast path and build no `Future` |
 * | [greetLater] | a `suspend fun` that really suspends: `await` must resolve once Kotlin resumes it |
