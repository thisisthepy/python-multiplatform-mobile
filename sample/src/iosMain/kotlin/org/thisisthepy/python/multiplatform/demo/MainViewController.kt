 * from inside a composable body -- on every recomposition, and only once the user had expanded
 * the section that hosted it.
 *
 * On iOS the shipped framework carries no stdlib, so `PYTHONHOME` has to point at one before this
 * runs; see `python-multiplatform/src/iosMain/README.md`.

 * Prints what each of `App`'s seven cards *would* show, to stdout.
 *
 * Sections 2 and 5-7 are behind buttons, and a simulator launched by `simctl` has nobody to press
 * them: `simctl` can install and launch, but it cannot tap. Without this the only sections a run
 * can be said to have exercised are the four that render eagerly, which is how "iOS compiles" and
 * "iOS runs" stayed indistinguishable for as long as they did. The UI is untouched -- this prints
 * the same calls the buttons make, so a divergence between platforms shows up in a log rather than
 * only under someone's thumb.
 *
 * Each line is caught separately on purpose. These sections fail independently on other targets
 * already (section 7's slow path is unwired here by design), and one throwing must not hide the
 * six that would have answered.
