 * wasmJs's bootstrap is the newest of the five, and the reason this file could be written at all
 * is `4472f83a`: `UpcallEntry.publish` installs `_pm_resolve` *and* `_pm_invoke` -- unlike
 * Android's history (`ProxyDemo.android.kt`'s doc), wasmJs never shipped a `publish` that left
 * `_pm_invoke` out, because it was written after that gap was already known. What makes it
 * possible with only one `@WasmExport` is `self`, not a second export -- see `UpcallEntry`'s own
 * class doc ("one export is enough for the whole bootstrap") and `WasmExports.kt` next to
 * `UpcallDemo.wasmJs.kt`.
 *
 * So this is the same two lines Android and iOS own: publish, then install.
