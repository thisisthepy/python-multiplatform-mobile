 *
 * `docs/upcall-async-design.md` explains why none of these can be in the table as they stand: a
 * CPython callback slot is a C frame that must hand back a `PyObject *` before it returns, and a
 * suspension has nothing to hand back. The fixtures exist so that the day an async convention
 * lands, the change in behaviour shows up as these tests failing rather than as silence.
 *
 * Each suspending declaration is paired with a non-suspending control in the same scope, so a
 * test asserting the suspending one is absent cannot pass by the whole scope having been dropped.

// or return type carries no such modifier. What makes each one unexposable is
// `KSType.isSuspendFunctionType` on the *type*, which is why the check lives beside
// `hasRenderableSignature` in `BindingPolicy` as its own predicate
// (`BindingPolicy.hasExposableTypes`) rather than folded into the declaration-shape checks.
//
// `docs/upcall-async-design.md` §2.1 measured the base case: the generated cast
// (`args[0] as kotlin.coroutines.SuspendFunction1<...>`) compiles and the runtime checkcast
// passes, because that classifier is real to the Kotlin compiler even though nothing in this
// compilation ever declares it in source -- there is no `invoke` entry for Python to call through,
// so what would cross is a handle Python can hold and hand back and nothing else. Everything from
// [handlerList] onward is a variation on where that same unusable classifier can hide: a generic
// type argument, a nullable wrapper, and a `typealias`.
