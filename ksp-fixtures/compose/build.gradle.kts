/**
 * The other end of `docs/pythonx-adapter-design.md` §5: a real `@Composable`, called from Python,
 * inside a real composition, drawing a real pixel.
 *
 * ### Why this is not `:ksp-fixtures:artifact`
 *
 * That module takes Compose as **plain Maven coordinates with no Compose plugin**, and its own
 * `build.gradle.kts` says why: what makes `Modifier.padding(16.dp)` reachable is the walker's gates
 * opening, not any cooperation from Compose's tooling, and a `Modifier` chain needs no composition at
 * all. A composable is the opposite case in both respects. It needs a `Composer`, which exists only
 * inside a composition, which needs the Compose compiler plugin to create -- so proving it here
 * rather than there keeps that claim intact instead of quietly weakening it.
 *
 * ### What the compiler plugin is and is not used for
 *
 * It compiles **one hand-written function**, `PythonComposition.kt`'s `PythonComposition`. The
 * generated fragment beside it calls no composable from Kotlin source and could not: a composable's
 * call site is emitted as bytecode (`ComposableThunks.kt`), because a Kotlin file facade has no
 * Kotlin name and the `$default` mask must be computed at run time. So the plugin's presence buys
 * exactly one composer and nothing else.

    // 1. `material3` -- `Text` is a *leaf*, reachable without ever filling a function-typed slot.
    // 2. `foundation.layout` -- `Column` is the container whose `content` declares no default, so it
    //    is the declaration that is unreachable until a Python callable can cross, which is what
    //    `ComposableRenderTest` renders.
    // 3. `ui.graphics` -- where every *value* material3 asks for is built: `Color`, and with it
    //    `ImageBitmap`, `BitmapPainter` and the `vector` and `painter` subpackages, since the match
    //    is a namespace one. `a6742a1c` pinned `Icon` and `lightColorScheme` as unreachable and this
    //    line is the whole of why: both were asking for a value from a package nothing walked. See
    //    `IconRenderTest`.
    // 4. `ui.res` -- the one thing a *constructed* value cannot be. An `ImageBitmap` with no pixels
    //    written into it is transparent, and writing them needs `Canvas.drawRect`, an **instance**
    //    method (`ArtifactScanner.kotlinCandidates` binds `ACC_STATIC` only). Loading an image is
    //    static all the way down -- `openResource` -> `loadImageBitmap`, and `painterResource` for
    //    the `Painter` overload -- so this is what makes `Icon` draw a pixel rather than merely
    //    compose.
