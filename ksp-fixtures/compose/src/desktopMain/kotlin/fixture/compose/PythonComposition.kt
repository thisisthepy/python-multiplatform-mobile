/**
 * **The one hand-written `@Composable` in the whole design**, and the only thing Python cannot do
 * for itself.
 *
 * ### Why exactly one, and not one per component
 *
 * The 2024 `pythonx-compose` wrote a Kotlin wrapper per widget -- 37 files, 28 of them empty --
 * and `docs/pythonx-adapter-design.md` §1 measures what that cost: `padding()` composed nothing and
 * `fill_max_size()` returned `self`, because a per-declaration wrapper is written once and then
 * never again. This is O(1) in the number of composables and stays O(1) by construction: it names no
 * composable, takes no composable-specific parameter, and knows nothing about the declaration Python
 * is about to call. Every `@Composable` in every artefact the walker binds goes through this one
 * function, because the only thing it supplies is the composer -- and there is exactly one composer,
 * not one per widget.
 *
 * ### What it actually supplies
 *
 * `$composer` is not a value, it is a *position*: `currentComposer` is an intrinsic the Compose
 * compiler plugin resolves to the composer parameter of the enclosing composable, so the only way to
 * obtain one is to be inside a composition. Everything else about calling a composable -- which
 * arguments were written, what `$default` mask that implies, what `$changed` should be -- is
 * arithmetic `pythonx` does in Python (`PythonxAdapter`'s `_bind_composable`), which is why it is
 * *not* here and why this stayed one function.
 *
 * The composer crosses as an ordinary `TypeTag.OBJECT` handle, which is `docs/ecosystem.md` §5b's
 * "the Python wrapper passes the composer as a value" and the same shape the 2024
 * `RuntimeKt.composableWrapper` used. The handle is registered here and released here, so the
 * lifetime is exactly the composition's -- `pythonx.push_composer` retains nothing and says so.
 *
 * ### What is deliberately not solved
 *
 * Recomposition. [source] is `exec`ed on every composition pass, so a Python body that is expensive
 * pays for it every frame, and a `@Composable` reached this way can never be *skipped* the way one
 * with stable parameters is. `docs/pythonx-adapter-design.md` §5.4 item 4 names this as a property to
 * measure before the shape is adopted for anything but a proof, and nothing here has measured it.

    // is a remembered value. See [PythonCallableArena].

/**
 * Who holds a Python callable, and the one hook that says when to let go.
 *
 * `docs/pythonx-adapter-design.md` §6 item 1: *"When Compose drops the slot, does anything tell the
 * Kotlin holder? `RememberObserver.onForgotten` is the only hook that reports it… Item 1 is the one
 * that fails silently and should be tested first."* This is that hook, wired to the one thing that
 * can act on it.
 *
 * ### Why the composition and not something shorter or longer
 *
 * | candidate holder | what it gets wrong |
 * |---|---|
 * | the composition **pass** | ends when `PythonComposition` returns, and Compose calls a stored `content` on every later recomposition |
 * | the `PyObject`'s own cleaner | fires whenever the collector reaches the Kotlin wrapper, which is not a time and is not every platform |
 * | `HandleTable` alone | a strong root nothing gives back: the handle goes into a slot and is never handed to Python, so there is no `__del__` to release it |
 * | **this** | `onRemembered` … `onForgotten` is exactly the interval in which Compose may call the content |
 *
 * ### Both ends, because a leak test alone would pass a double release
 *
 * [PythonCallableScope.close] reports how many callables it actually released and answers `0` on
 * every later call, and [released] accumulates that -- so a test can assert that the reference count
 * came back *and* that nothing released it twice. `agent-rules` §14 is why those are two assertions:
 * a reference dropped twice does not fail where it happens, it corrupts a free list and surfaces
 * somewhere unrelated.
 *
 * `onAbandoned` closes the scope too. It is the case where the composition that created this was
 * discarded before it was ever applied, so nothing will ever call `onForgotten`; the two are mutually
 * exclusive by Compose's contract, and [close] being idempotent means it does not matter here if
 * that contract is ever weakened.

/**
 * The one seed `ComposableRenderTest`'s render-proof tests need that neither the artefact walker
 * nor `pythonx` can supply on their own: a `Modifier` chain has to start somewhere, and the thing it
 * starts from is `Modifier` the *expression* -- `androidx.compose.ui.Modifier.Companion`, an object
 * instance the walker cannot hand out because it only binds functions.
 * `ksp-fixtures/artifact`'s `ComposeSeed.kt` solved the exact same gap the same way, for the
 * non-composable half of Compose's surface; this is that solution, in this module, so `Spacer` --
 * whose one parameter has no default and is therefore not omittable -- has something to be given.
 *
 * Bound by KSP, not the artefact walker: a plain top-level function in this module's own source is
 * an ordinary `FunctionTable` entry, reached from Python through `PythonProxySource` under this
 * module's own Kotlin package name (`fixture.compose.empty_modifier`), the same route
 * `WalkedArtifactComposeModifierTest` uses for `fixture.artifact.emptyModifier`. `pythonx`'s
 * `_BY_PACKAGE` dispatch -- built over `ArtifactTable` -- never sees it, and does not need to: the
 * `Modifier` handle this returns is an ordinary `TypeTag.OBJECT` value, indistinguishable at the
 * boundary from one a walked declaration produced, so it can be threaded into a `pythonx`-bound
 * composable's `modifier` slot once built.
