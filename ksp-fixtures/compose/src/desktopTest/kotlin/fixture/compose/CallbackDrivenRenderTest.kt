/**
 * **A Python callback, driven by a real event** -- the third wall `ebe3365f` left standing.
 *
 * ### What was missing, and why it mattered
 *
 * Every render proof in this module so far is a *static rasterisation*: build a scene, call
 * `render()`, count pixels. That proves a composable was reached and drew, and it can say nothing at
 * all about a slot whose whole purpose is to be **called back** -- `Checkbox.onCheckedChange`,
 * `Slider.onValueChange`, `TextField.onValueChange`. `ComposableBindingTest` proves those slots are
 * *described* (`kotlin.Function1(kotlin.Boolean)->kotlin.Unit`) and `FunctionSlotBindingTest` proves
 * a Python callable can be *put* in one, and nothing anywhere proved one is ever *invoked*.
 *
 * ### What delivers the event
 *
 * `ImageComposeScene.sendPointerEvent`, which is on the same class the rasterisation tests already
 * use -- so this needs no new harness, no window and no display. A press and a release at the
 * component's centre is what Compose turns into a click, and `Checkbox` is the smallest bound
 * declaration that reacts to one with a value rather than with a `Unit`: the argument it hands back
 * is the thing to assert, because a callback invoked with the wrong value and a callback invoked at
 * all are different claims.
 *
 * ### Why the redraw is a second scene
 *
 * `Checkbox` is stateless: what it draws comes from its `checked` argument, which is Python's to
 * hold. Clicking it invalidates Compose's own interaction state, not `PythonComposition`'s -- so the
 * scene that received the click will not re-run the Python body, and asserting on its second frame
 * would be asserting on nothing. A **fresh** scene over the same body reads the Python variable the
 * callback wrote, which is the honest way round: the pixels prove what Python holds now, and the
 * `_events` list proves how it got there.

     * **The fourth wall, and the one `7d6c0a1` in `pythonx-compose` left standing:** a
     * `(String) -> Unit` slot, driven by real key input rather than by a pointer.
     *
     * ### Why this needs a key event and not another `sendPointerEvent`
     *
     * `Checkbox` and `Switch` above are driven end to end by a click alone -- the value the callback
     * receives is derived from the control's own toggled state, not from anything the test supplies.
     * `TextField`'s `onValueChange` carries the *typed* string, so the only way to drive it honestly
     * is to deliver characters, which is a different plumbing: `ImageComposeScene` exposes a second
     * entry point for it, `sendKeyEvent`, and it was never exercised anywhere in this module.
     *
     * ### What makes a character actually commit, found by decompiling (no sources jar for this
     * Compose version): three dead ends before this one
     *
     * `androidx.compose.ui.input.key.KeyEvent(key, type, codePoint, ...)` is the public factory for a
     * synthetic key event, and the first three shapes tried with it all reached the focused node --
     * `scene.sendKeyEvent` returned `true` for a bare `Modifier.onKeyEvent` -- and still left
     * `TextField`'s `onValueChange` uncalled, with `sendKeyEvent` itself returning `false`:
     *
     * 1. `KeyEventType.KeyDown` with a codepoint, on the theory that a "key down" is what typing is.
     *    `TextFieldKeyInput_desktopKt.isTypedEvent` (decompiled) does not look at this event's own
     *    `type` field at all for the character-commit path.
     * 2. Explicit focus via `FocusRequester.requestFocus()` in a `SideEffect`, in case the click's
     *    tap-to-focus gesture was the gap. Confirmed *not* the gap: `Modifier.onFocusChanged` on the
     *    same field reported `isFocused` going `false -> true`, and the key was still refused.
     * 3. More render passes, in case some `LaunchedEffect`-driven input-session start just hadn't run
     *    yet. A bare `LaunchedEffect(Unit) { }` in the same harness does run, so that theory falls too.
     *
     * `isTypedEvent-ZmokQxo`'s decompiled body is what actually decides it: it calls
     * `AwtEvents_desktopKt.getAwtEventOrNull` on the event, and returns `false` outright if that is
     * `null` or its own AWT `getID()` is not `400` (`KEY_TYPED`) -- checking the *wrapped native AWT
     * event*, never the Compose-level `type` this test's first three attempts were varying. The public
     * `KeyEvent(...)` factory takes a `nativeEvent: Any?` parameter defaulting to `null`, which is
     * exactly the gap: every synthetic event built without one is invisible to this check, regardless
     * of `type` or focus. [typedKey] supplies a real `java.awt.event.KeyEvent(..., KEY_TYPED, ...,
     * keyChar)` there, which is what `sendPointerEvent`-only attempts have no equivalent gap for --
     * that boundary takes structured Compose values directly and never asks whether something upstream
     * produced them.
     *
     * (`AwtKeyEvent(...).toComposeEvent()`, the obvious way to build that wrapped pair, does not
     * compile from this module: it is `internal` to `ui-desktop`'s own compilation -- public in the
     * class file, since Kotlin `internal` erases to public JVM bytecode, but rejected by the Kotlin
     * compiler's module check. [typedKey] builds the same shape by hand through the public factory
     * instead.)
     *
     * ### Why the field is clicked before it is typed into
     *
     * A key event has no target of its own -- `ImageComposeScene.sendKeyEvent` delivers it to whatever
     * currently holds focus, the same way a real window would. `BasicTextField` (which M3's `TextField`
     * wraps) requests focus on press the same way `Checkbox` and `Switch` already register clicks, so
     * the press-and-release this class already uses for a toggle is reused here for exactly the same
     * reason: to establish, mechanically, that this is the field the keystroke reaches, not composition
     * order or the only focusable node in the scene.
     *
     * ### Why this drives one keystroke, not two, inside a single scene
     *
     * A second keystroke inside the *same* scene was tried first, on the theory that it would prove
     * more (accumulation, not just a single character crossing). It fails, and not on anything this
     * class's mechanism is responsible for: M3's `TextField(value: String, onValueChange, ...)` copies
     * its *own* `value` parameter back onto the field's internal editable state on every recomposition
     * -- `textFieldValueState.copy(text = value)`, the standard "controlled" pattern -- and
     * `PythonComposition`'s [source] is only `exec`ed when *its own* composable scope recomposes.
     * Nothing about a Python callback mutating a plain Python list is visible to Compose's snapshot
     * system, so `PythonComposition` never recomposes on its own after `_tf_on_change` runs, and the
     * `value` fed to `TextField` stays whatever it was at the scene's first composition for the scene's
     * whole life. Confirmed by driving `'h'` then `'i'` in one scene: `_tf_events` comes back
     * `['h', 'i']`, not `['h', 'hi']` -- each keystroke lands on the *original* empty value, because
     * nothing ever told `TextField` the first one had happened. A parallel probe with a plain Kotlin
     * `mutableStateOf` in place of the Python list (not committed -- built to isolate this, then
     * discarded once the cause was confirmed) accumulates correctly in exactly the same scene, which is
     * what places the cause in the boundary between Python state and Compose's snapshot system, not in
     * key-event delivery. [twoKeystrokesAccumulateAcrossTwoFreshScenes] below shows the shape that
     * *does* work: the same one this class already uses for `Checkbox` and `Switch`, extended by one
     * more scene.
