/**
 * **`Icon`, drawing pixels from Python** -- the declaration `a6742a1c` pinned as unreachable, and
 * the layer that pin was really about.
 *
 * ### What the old pin actually measured
 *
 * `a6742a1c`'s `iconHasNoReachableSourceForAnyOfItsThreeRequiredImageTypes` asserted, over
 * the walked table rather than over a guess, that nothing in it returns an `ImageBitmap`, an
 * `ImageVector` or a `Painter`. That was true, and it was true for a reason that had nothing to do
 * with `Icon`: `artifactIncludePackages` named two packages and neither was where any of the three
 * is built. The pin measured this module's `build.gradle.kts`.
 *
 * Two more packages -- `androidx.compose.ui.graphics` and `androidx.compose.ui.res` -- take the walk
 * from 230 bindings to 320, and with them two of `Icon`'s three overloads become reachable. The
 * third does not, and *why* is the useful half; see
 * [imageVectorIsUnreachableBecauseItsBuilderIsANestedClassTheWalkerNeverOpens].
 *
 * ### Why a loaded image and not a constructed one
 *
 * `ImageBitmap(width, height)` is bound and Python can call it, and it is **useless for an ink
 * proof**: the pixels it allocates are zero. `Icon` draws its image through `ColorFilter.tint`,
 * which is `BlendMode.SrcIn` -- it replaces colour and *keeps alpha* -- so a zeroed bitmap draws
 * nothing however correctly every layer below worked. Measured, both ways: `hasAlpha = false` (which
 * tags the surface `OPAQUE`) draws `0` too.
 *
 * Writing pixels into one needs `Canvas.drawRect`, and that is an **instance** method.
 * `ArtifactScanner.kotlinCandidates` filters `ownerNode.methods` on `ACC_PUBLIC and ACC_STATIC`, so
 * no instance method of any class is bound anywhere in this table -- the walker's whole surface is
 * top-level functions and extensions. Loading an image is static all the way down, which is why
 * `androidx.compose.ui.res` is in the walk and why the ink proof below goes through
 * `painterResource` rather than through the constructor.
 *
 * The `ImageBitmap` overload still gets a proof of its own, and it is positional rather than
 * inked -- exactly the shape `ModifierSeededRenderTest` uses for `Spacer`, and for the same reason.
 * See [pythonBuildsAnImageBitmapAndComposeLaysTheIconOutAtThatWidth].

     * `a6742a1c` recorded two reasons and neither survives as stated. The package is walked now. And
     * the builder is not blocked for being *stateful*: [pythonLoadsAPainterAndIconDrawsIt] carries an
     * owned handle out of one walked call and into another already, which is the whole of what a
     * builder needs.
     *
     * It is blocked because `ImageVector.Builder` is a **nested class**. `ArtifactScanner.scan`
     * skips every class whose binary name contains `$` before it reads a single member, on the
     * grounds that a nested class's binary name is not how Kotlin spells its qualified name -- so the
     * builder's constructor and its `build()` are not declined on their merits, they are never seen.
     * Two further doors are shut behind it, and both are worth naming because either would open
     * `ImageVector` without the nested-class question being answered at all:
     *
     * - `ImageVector.Builder`'s members would still need `CallableKind.METHOD`, which the walker
     *   never emits (`ACC_STATIC` only);
     * - `loadXmlImageVector` *is* static and takes an `org.xml.sax.InputSource`, a JDK type that is
     *   not on the artefact classpath, so `resolveKotlinType` cannot find a public class for it and
     *   declines the whole declaration. That is the same reason `loadImageBitmap(InputStream)` and
     *   `openResource(String)` are absent from the walk while `painterResource(String)` is present.
     *
     * What *is* bound is `ImageVectorKt.path`, the top-level extension **on** that builder -- a
     * receiver whose only possible source is the class that was skipped. That asymmetry is what this
     * asserts, because it is the thing that changes first.
