/**
 * **A constant held by an object reaches Compose and changes a layout** -- the half `80318c16` left
 * unproven.
 *
 * That commit taught the walker to bind what an `object` or a companion holds, and proved it where
 * the walker lives: two plugin tests assert that `AbsoluteAlignment.TopLeft` and `Alignment.Center`
 * arrive as zero-argument getters with the right body. What it could not say is that the value
 * survives the crossing -- a getter that returned the wrong singleton, or one whose handle never
 * resolved, would satisfy both of those and still be useless.
 *
 * ### Why arrangement rather than alignment
 *
 * An arrangement is observable without a probe. `Row(horizontal_arrangement=...)` decides *where*
 * its children sit, so two arrangements put the same child at two different x positions in the same
 * scene, and the pixels say which one arrived. Alignment would need a measure policy of this test's
 * own to read it back, which is the shape `LayoutIdRenderTest` already carries for a different
 * reason; there is nothing to learn from a second copy of it.
 *
 * `Start` versus `End` is the pair, because they are opposite ends of the same axis: a wrapper that
 * ignored the argument entirely would place both at the same edge, and a wrapper that resolved some
 * *other* constant would have to resolve exactly the opposite one to pass both assertions.
 *
 * ### Two things this test had to get right, and both are facts rather than details
 *
 * **The constant is *read*, not called.** `Arrangement.Start` -- no parentheses. The adaptation
 * layer branches on [python.multiplatform.reflection.CallableKind]: a
 * [python.multiplatform.reflection.CallableKind.STATIC_GETTER] is invoked once by `PythonxAdapter`
 * itself and handed back as a value, so `Arrangement.$constant()` -- the spelling this test used
 * before the branch existed -- now raises `TypeError: '...' object is not callable` instead of
 * returning the right thing for the wrong reason. Read without being called, the value round-trips
 * as `Arrangement.Start` does in Kotlin.
 *
 * **The row is given a width.** A `Row` wraps its content, so with no width constraint there is no
 * spare space and every arrangement puts the child in the same place -- the `Start` assertion passed
 * for that reason before the width was added, which is exactly the kind of accidental pass the
 * opposite-end control exists to catch.
