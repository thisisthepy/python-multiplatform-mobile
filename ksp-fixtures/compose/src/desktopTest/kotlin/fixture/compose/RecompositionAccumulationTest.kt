/**
 * **What a live UI costs**: how much one composition accumulates over [PASSES] recompositions.
 *
 * `ce1de0c3` recorded the shape of the problem without a number -- *"a wrapper is allocated per
 * crossing and there is no interning, so n recompositions hold n Python callables"* -- and
 * `ComposableRenderTest.theHolderSurvivesARecompositionAndReleasesBothCallablesAtDisposal` proves it
 * for exactly n = 2, where "2" is indistinguishable from "the two different callables that were
 * deliberately passed". This measures the case that matters instead: **the same callable, passed
 * again on every pass**, which is what a UI that recomposes several times a second actually does.
 *
 * ### The three things counted, and why none of them alone is the answer
 *
 * | counter | what it moves for |
 * |---|---|
 * | [PythonCallableScope.liveCount] | one per wrapper the scope is holding open |
 * | `HandleTable.liveCount` | one per wrapper root, plus whatever an invocation left rooted |
 * | `sys.getrefcount` of the Python callable | one per **thunk** built over it, which is the reference Kotlin is holding |
 *
 * The refcount is the honest one -- it is Python's own accounting and cannot be fooled by a Kotlin
 * table that forgot to grow -- but it moves by one for a *thunk*, and `_callable_thunk` hands a plain
 * slot's callable over unwrapped, so for those it moves for the callable itself. The scope count is
 * the one to fix; the other two are there so that "the scope stopped growing" cannot pass while the
 * cost merely moved somewhere else.
 *
 * ### What counts as the same callable
 *
 * Not `is`. A `lambda:` written inline is a **new object on every pass** (`docs/pythonx-adapter-design.md`
 * records this), so an identity test on the callable interns nothing at all for the spelling that
 * appears in every example in this module. The key is structural and is described where it is
 * computed, in `PythonxAdapter`'s `_intern_key`; what this file asserts is the consequence:
 * `Column(content=lambda: Text('hi'))` composed [PASSES] times holds **one** wrapper, and
 * `Column(content=_named)` holds one too.
 *
 * [aCapturedValueThatChangesIsADifferentCallableAndIsNotShared] is the other half and is not a
 * failure: two lambdas that close over different values do different things, and giving them one
 * wrapper would render the first pass's value forever.

    /**
     * **The precondition a release point between recompositions would need**, and it holds -- which
     * is not what was expected.
     *
     * The sweep worth wanting is: at the end of a Python pass, give back every wrapper the pass
     * neither created nor reused, because the body just re-ran and re-supplied everything still in
     * use. Its soundness rests on one claim -- *nothing Compose still holds goes untouched across a
     * pass* -- and the obvious way for that to fail is **skipping**. Interning makes it plausible:
     * reusing a wrapper hands `Column` the *same object* in its `content` slot, so
     * `composer.changed(content)` answers false, and a `Column` that skips keeps its children as they
     * are without re-composing them. A `content` that itself declares a `content` would then have its
     * inner wrapper left untouched while Compose was still holding it, and a sweep would release
     * something live.
     *
     * **It does not happen here.** The measured shape over [SHORT_PASSES] passes of
     * `Column(content=lambda: Column(content=_acc_inner))` is *two* crossings on every pass, not two
     * and then one, and the inner content is invoked once per pass throughout. Nothing is skipped, so
     * every live wrapper is re-supplied every pass and the sweep's precondition is satisfied for this
     * shape.
     *
     * ### What this does and does not license
     *
     * It licenses the sweep for the shapes measured here. It does **not** prove Compose can never
     * skip a subtree whose `content` came from Python -- `PythonComposition` is re-entered with a
     * changed `String` on every pass, which is the strongest possible invalidation, and a host that
     * recomposed it for a subtler reason might see `$composer.skipping` come out true. So this test
     * exists as the **guard** rather than as the sweep: it is what would go red first if that
     * changed, and it should be read before anything releases a wrapper before disposal.
     *
     * There is a second shape this test says nothing about: a slot Compose **retains across a
     * re-supply**. `LaunchedEffect(key) { block }` keeps the block it already has when `key` is
     * unchanged and drops the new one, so a pass that supplies a *different* wrapper -- a lambda
     * whose capture moved -- leaves the retained one untouched and still live. Nothing in this module
     * binds such a declaration today, so `RetainedSlotSweepPreconditionTest` measures it directly
     * against `remember(key)` instead (the mechanism `LaunchedEffect(key)` is built on) -- and finds
     * the shape unsafe for a same-pass sweep: see `PythonCallables.kt`'s "release point" section for
     * the numbers and the verdict.
     *
     * The reason to want it at all is
     * [aCapturedValueThatChangesIsADifferentCallableAndIsNotShared]: interning bounds a repeated
     * callable to one wrapper and leaves a callable whose capture changes at one per distinct value.
