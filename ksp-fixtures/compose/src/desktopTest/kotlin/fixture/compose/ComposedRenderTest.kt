/**
 * **`Modifier.composed` admits a real composer**, settling `docs/pythonx-adapter-design.md` §9.2/§9.4's
 * open question: "unverified whether `composed`'s own contract... admits a composer at all."
 * `fixture.compose.pythonComposed` (`PythonComposed.kt`) is the hand-written wrapper; this proves two
 * independent things about it, the way every other §9 render test in this module proves both a
 * positive claim and a control rather than one alone.
 *
 * 1. [aFactoryProducedModifierIsAppliedAndItsSizeCrosses] -- the `Modifier` [factory] returns actually
 *    reaches the node Compose measures, and the *value* Python chose crosses (not a stub that always
 *    applies the same fixed size, and not a no-op that leaves the node at its intrinsic size).
 * 2. [theSameCompositionReusesTheRememberedSlotAcrossRecompositions] -- the composer `factory` runs
 *    with is wired into a real, positionally-stable slot table, not a placeholder: `remember` inside
 *    `pythonComposed`'s `composed { }` lambda allocates once and is *reused* across recompositions of
 *    the same node, even though `PythonComposition` re-`exec`s the Python source (and so calls
 *    `pythonComposed` itself afresh, building a brand new `ComposedModifier` Kotlin object) on every
 *    pass. That persistence is `Modifier.composed`'s whole reason to exist (it is what lets
 *    `Modifier.clickable`'s internal `remember(interactionSource) { ... }` survive a modifier chain
 *    rebuilt from scratch every recomposition) and a fake/inert composer could not produce it.

     * [ComposedInvocationSlot] keeps:
     *
     * - [ComposedInvocationSlot.remembersAllocated] -- how many times `remember`'s factory itself ran.
     *   `1`, not [PASSES], is the claim: the slot table remembered across every later pass.
     * - the surviving slot's own [ComposedInvocationSlot.invocations] -- how many times the
     *   `composed { }` lambda body ran at all. Equal to [PASSES]: `pythonComposed` (and so `factory`)
     *   really did get re-invoked, and re-materialized, on every recomposition rather than being
     *   skipped or cached wholesale.
     *
     * Both together are what a placeholder composer could not produce: either `remember` would not be
     * usable at all (no slot table to remember into), or it would allocate fresh every pass (no
