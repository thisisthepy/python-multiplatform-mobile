/**
 * The acceptance criterion, end to end: **`Text('hi')` written in Python draws pixels through
 * `androidx.compose.material3.Text`.**
 *
 * Every layer is the real one. `material3-desktop.jar` is walked by `ArtifactScanner`; the composable
 * it finds is bound with its `$composer`, `$changed` and `$default` slots exposed; its call site is a
 * `.class` `ComposableThunks` emitted at build time, because a Kotlin file facade has no Kotlin name;
 * `pythonx` computes the `$default` mask from which arguments the Python call wrote; the composer
 * comes from [PythonComposition], the one hand-written `@Composable`; and `ImageComposeScene` runs a
 * real composition and rasterises it.
 *
 * ### How "it drew" is decided
 *
 * By counting pixels that are not the background. Two scenes are rendered from the same code path
 * -- one whose Python body calls `Text`, one whose body does nothing -- and the assertion is that the
 * first has ink and the second has none. That is deliberately not an image comparison against a
 * checked-in reference: this test has to survive a Compose version bump changing a font metric,
 * while still failing if nothing composes.
 *
 * A second scene renders `Text('hi')` and `Text('hi hi hi hi')` and asserts the second has strictly
 * more ink, which is what stops "any non-empty frame" from passing -- the text that was written has
 * to be the text that was drawn.

     *
     * The ink first, so this is still a rendering claim and not only a marshalling one. Then the
     * receiver's **Python type name**, because that is the whole of what makes the value useful:
     * `pythonx` keys `_BY_RECEIVER` on the Kotlin type name, so a proxy built under the wrong name
     * would carry the right `ColumnScope` and have none of its extensions on it. `ColumnScope` is
     * an `androidx` type this test never names on the Kotlin side -- it comes out of the walked
     * jar's metadata, through the slot's type name, into a Python class.

     *
     * The same argument [theWalkedTableCarriesTextWithItsSyntheticSlots] makes about `Text`, and

     * as a zero or a `null` that only the mask tells the callee to overwrite. Shifting every bit by
     * one -- which is exactly what the uncorrected slot-index arithmetic did, since the receiver
     * occupies slot 0 and no `$default` bit -- was tried, and the frame does not come out slightly
     * wrong: it fails with
     *
     *     Parameter specified as non-null is null: method
     *     androidx.compose.foundation.selection.SelectableKt.selectable-O2vRcR0,
     *     parameter ${'$'}this${'$'}selectable
     *
     * because `modifier` keeps the `null` its bit no longer claims. A mask off by a single bit
     * cannot render a slightly wrong picture; it cannot render one at all, which is why this is a
     * rendering test rather than a table one.
     *
     * The second scene is the guard against the weaker claim: a selected `NavigationBarItem` draws
     * its own indicator, so "something was drawn" would pass with an icon that never ran. The icon is
     * a nested Python callable inside a forwarded receiver, and its text is what the ink is compared
