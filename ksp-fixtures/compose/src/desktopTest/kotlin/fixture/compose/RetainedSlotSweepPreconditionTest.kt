/**
 * **The measurement `PythonCallables.kt`'s "release point" section names as missing**: a slot Compose
 * retains across a re-supply -- the shape `remember(key) { value }` and `LaunchedEffect(key) { block }`
 * both have -- fed a callable whose capture changes every pass, so a *different* wrapper crosses on
 * every pass while the retaining slot goes on handing out the first one.
 *
 * ### Why this drives `pythonx.runtime.newFunction` directly instead of through a walked composable
 *
 * No walked declaration in this fixture's `androidx.compose.material3`/`foundation.layout` surface
 * retains across a re-supply -- `Column`'s `content` is invoked with whatever was passed on *every*
 * pass, which is exactly what
 * `RecompositionAccumulationTest.everyLiveWrapperIsResuppliedOnEveryPassEvenWhenNested` measured, and
 * that KDoc says outright: "nothing in this module binds such a declaration today." Nothing here adds
 * one either -- a retaining composable reachable *from Python* would need `FragmentScanner` to thread a
 * `$composer`, which is `ArtifactScanner`/`ComposableThunks`' job and is wired only for the androidx
 * packages this module walks.
 *
 * `pythonx.runtime.newFunction` is what any walked call site's crossing calls under the hood
 * (`PythonxAdapter._make_function`), and `PythonxAdapter.install()` -- already needed here for nothing
 * more than its dynamic `pythonx.*` package finder -- registers `PythonCallables.Fragment` as part of
 * installing, which is what makes `from pythonx.runtime import newFunction` resolve at all
 * (`PythonCallables.Fragment` is `internal` to `:python-multiplatform`, so this file cannot register it
 * directly the way `PythonCallablesProxyArgumentTest` does there). Calling it here, once per pass, with
 * a real capture-bearing Python closure, and feeding the resulting handle into a real `remember(key)`,
 * produces the same crossing a retaining walked declaration would produce without one having to exist.

    /**
     * **The number the sweep's precondition was waiting on.** [PASSES] passes, a constant retention
     * key, and a callable whose capture is the pass number -- so every pass crosses a genuinely
     * different wrapper (`aCapturedValueThatChangesIsADifferentCallableAndIsNotShared`'s shape) while
     * `remember("fixed")` keeps handing out pass 0's.
     *
     * Three things are measured, not assumed:
     *
     * 1. [RetainedHandleProbe.current] stays pass 0's handle for all [PASSES] passes -- confirms
     *    `remember(key)` really ignores the re-supply, in this exact Compose runtime, for this exact
     *    shape.
     * 2. [PythonCallableScope.liveCount] grows by exactly one every pass and [PythonCallableScope
     *    .reuseCount] stays zero -- confirms pass 0's wrapper is *never touched again* after pass 0:
     *    not rebuilt (its capture never recurs) and not reused (its key is never asked for again).
     * 3. Pass 0's Python callable's own refcount, read immediately after it crossed and again after
     *    every later pass has crossed and been discarded, is unchanged -- confirms the reference
     *    [PythonCallableScope] is holding for it is still there, not doubled and not dropped.
     *
     * (1) and (2) together are the sweep's failure case stated in counters: the wrapper a same-pass
     * "untouched" test would flag for release ((2)) is exactly the one something still needs ((1)).
     * (3) is why that release would be worse than a leak (`agent-rules` §14) rather than merely
     * redundant -- the reference is real and single, not already gone.
