/**
 * The artefact walker's klib half, end to end: a real third-party `.klib` the build resolves,
 * walked at build time by `KlibScanner`, installed into the same `UpcallTable` KSP's own fragments
 * go into.
 *
 * `:ksp-fixtures:artifact` is `docs/ecosystem.md` §5b's second producer over a **jar** -- this is
 * the same producer over a **klib**, ROADMAP §16e's "investigated, not implemented" half. One target
 * only, and it is `androidNativeArm64` rather than `desktop`: a jar is what a JVM target resolves, a
 * klib is what a Kotlin/Native target resolves, and `PythonArtifactBindingsTask
 * .artifactConfiguration`/`.artifactSourceSet` are single-valued (ROADMAP §16f #1) -- one module can
 * wire one walked configuration, so this fixture is the klib producer's own module rather than a
 * second target bolted onto `:artifact`.
 *
 * `kotlinx-coroutines-core` is the klib walked, for the same reason JUnit is `:artifact`'s: a real,
 * independently-versioned third-party artefact nothing here controls or cooperates with.
 *
 * ### The suite is linked by the build and run by hand
 *
 * KGP gives `androidNativeArm64` a `linkDebugTestAndroidNativeArm64` and **no run task** -- it
 * registers one only where it knows how to reach a host, and an Android device is neither the build
 * machine nor `simctl`. `:python-multiplatform` solved that for itself with a hand-written
 * `androidNativeArm64Test` task (device selection, `adb push --sync` of a 60 MB stdlib, a
 * TeamCity-to-JUnit-XML parser) that is project-local. Until that is generalised, this module's
 * suite runs like this, reusing the payload that task already stages on the device:
 *
 *     ./gradlew :python-multiplatform:androidNativeArm64Test   # once: stages lib/ and the stdlib
 *     ./gradlew :ksp-fixtures:klib-artifact:linkDebugTestAndroidNativeArm64
 *     D=/data/local/tmp/pmp-nativetest-arm64-v8a
 *     adb push ksp-fixtures/klib-artifact/build/bin/androidNativeArm64/debugTest/test.kexe \
 *       $D/klibtest.kexe
 *     adb shell "chmod 755 $D/klibtest.kexe && cd $D && \
 *       LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$D/lib PYTHONHOME=$D ./klibtest.kexe --ktest_logger=TEAMCITY"
 *
 * **A green ordinary build therefore says these tests compile and link, not that they pass.**
