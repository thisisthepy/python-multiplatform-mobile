/**
 * The artefact walker end to end: a real third-party jar the build resolves, walked at build time,
 * installed into the same `UpcallTable` KSP's own fragments go into, and imported from Python.
 *
 * `docs/ecosystem.md` §5b names two producers of bindings and splits them by *what they look at* --
 * KSP the consumer's own source, the walker everything the build resolves. `:ksp-fixtures:app`
 * covers the first. Nothing covered the second, which is why `androidx.compose.material3` was
 * believed to be unreachable.
 *
 * Deliberately a module of its own rather than another target in `:ksp-fixtures:app`: that module's
 * `CommonInstallTest` asserts `UpcallTable.moduleNames` **exactly**, and a walked artefact appearing
 * there would be a change to what `FunctionTable` means rather than an addition beside it. Keeping
 * the two apart in the build is the same judgement `ArtifactTableRenderingTest` records for the
 * generated code.
