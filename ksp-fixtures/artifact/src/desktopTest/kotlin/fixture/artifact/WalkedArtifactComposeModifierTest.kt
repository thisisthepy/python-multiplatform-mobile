/**
 * `Modifier.padding(16.dp).size(24.dp)`, built from Python, out of the real Compose jars.
 *
 * ### What this is the end of
 *
 * `docs/kotlin-extensions-in-python.md` §3 measured the artefact walker binding **zero**
 * declarations from all 19 Compose desktop jars, and named two gates that each produced that zero on
 * their own: the metadata-kind gate (a Kotlin top-level function hides behind a file facade whose
 * JVM name Kotlin cannot spell) and the type gate (`Modifier` is an ordinary interface, and
 * `boundaryTypeOf` had no representation for one). A third rule, dropping any name carried by more
 * than one overload, took `padding`, `size`, `background`, `border` and 29 other `Modifier` names
 * even once those were open.
 *
 * All three are gone, and this is what that buys: a chain assembled in Python, out of Compose's own
 * `androidx.compose.foundation.layout` functions, under Compose's own names.
 *
 * ### Why no `Composer` appears anywhere
 *
 * A `Modifier` extension is not a `@Composable` -- §2.6 counted exactly one function that is both,
 * out of 500 -- so `padding` is an ordinary function returning an ordinary object and needs no
 * composition to run. Composables are a separate problem with a separate blocker
 * (`docs/pythonx-adapter-design.md` §5.3) and nothing here touches them. This module does not even
 * apply the Compose compiler plugin.
 *
 * ### What Python actually holds
 *
 * An integer. A `Modifier` crosses as a `HandleTable` handle (`TypeTag.OBJECT`), so each link of the
 * chain is a fresh handle and **each one is a strong root until something releases it**.
 *
 * This used to leak three per run, then two once the two walked links came back wrapped so Python
 * drops their handles when it drops the chain -- **one still leaked**: `emptyModifier()` is a KSP
 * entry, and KSP emitted no `returnTypeName`, which is the gate, because `TypeTag.OBJECT` also
 * covers a `PyObject` that may itself be an `int`, and owning one of those would release a handle
 * nobody issued.
 *
 * That gap is closed: `FragmentScanner` now fills `returnTypeName` (and `paramNames`/
 * `paramTypeNames`/`paramHasDefault`) at every call site that produces a [CallableEntryModel][
 * python.multiplatform.ksp.CallableEntryModel], so a KSP-generated `TypeTag.OBJECT` result is
 * owned exactly like a walked one is. [emptyModifierGivesItsHandleBackWhenPythonDropsIt] is the
 * measured claim -- a [HandleTable.liveCount] that returns to baseline once Python drops the
 * result, not "it did not crash" -- and
 * [emptyModifierDoesNotFreeANewOwnersSlotOnADoubleRelease] pins the other half that turning
 * ownership on puts at risk: a double release must not free a slot a new owner has since taken.
 *
 * Wrapping each return in the class rendered for its own type is still `§4.1`'s proxy and still
 * does not exist: the walker emits no `ReflectedClass`, so no rendered class has ever shared a name
 * with a walked return type.
 *
 * ### The overload names
 *
 * `padding__Dp` and `size__Dp` are not decoration. `androidx.compose.foundation.layout.padding` has
 * four overloads -- `PaddingValues`, one `Dp`, two `Dp`s, four `Dp`s -- and the walker refuses to
 * pick between them (see `ArtifactScanner.disambiguateOverloads`). The suffix is the caller saying
 * which one, and `padding__Dp` is the one a reader means by "16dp of padding".
