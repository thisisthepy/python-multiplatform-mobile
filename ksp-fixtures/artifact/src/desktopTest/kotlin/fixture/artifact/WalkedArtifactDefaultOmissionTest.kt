/**
 * `docs/pythonx-adapter-design.md` §4.5, closed against the real jars: **Compose's own functions,
 * called from Python with their required arguments and nothing else.**
 *
 * ### What was wrong
 *
 * `WalkedArtifactComposeModifierTest` proves the walker reaches Compose, and every call in it passes
 * every argument -- because that was all a generated body could do. §4.5 measures what that costs:
 * across the `Modifier` surface **254 of 435 parameters (58%) declare a default**, and the values a
 * caller would have had to supply instead are objects (`Alignment`, `TextStyle`) the type gate does
 * not bind, so Python could not have supplied them at any price. The bound surface was reachable and
 * unusable at the same time.
 *
 * ### What closes it
 *
 * A walked body now carries one Kotlin call expression per subset of its defaulted parameters and
 * selects between them on `args[i] == null` (`ArtifactScanner.presenceBranchedCall`), and `pythonx`
 * fills a missing argument with that sentinel. The default value itself is carried nowhere:
 * `@Metadata` records only the *flag*, so the only thing that can produce `Alignment.Center` is
 * `kotlinc` compiling a call that does not mention `align` -- which is exactly what the branch is.
 *
 * ### Why these functions
 *
 * All of them are ordinary functions, not composables -- no composable is in the table at all, since
 * the arity check in `ArtifactScanner` declines every one for the synthetic `$composer`/`$changed`
 * parameters its JVM signature carries -- and each has a default that **cannot be reproduced from
 * the Python side**, so an assertion cannot pass for the wrong reason. `ComposeSeed.kt`'s KDoc has
 * the table; the shortest form is `wrapContentSize`, whose default is an `Alignment` no bound
 * declaration produces.
 *
 * Every claim is paired with a control that must answer `False`, for the reason
 * `WalkedArtifactComposeModifierTest.theSameChainComparedAgainstADifferentPaddingDoesNotMatch`
 * gives: a test that only ever sees a `True` cannot tell "Compose ran with the default" from "the
 * comparison never executed".
 *
 * Asserted inside Python for this module's usual reason: `Python3.exec` raises a Kotlin
 * `PyException` carrying the Python error, so a failed `assert` fails the test with its own message.
