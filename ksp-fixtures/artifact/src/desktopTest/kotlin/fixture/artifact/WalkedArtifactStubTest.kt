/**
 * The `.pyi` stubs the **build** generated, checked against the table the same build installed.
 *
 * Every assertion here reads `build/generated/pythonStubs/desktopMain`, written by
 * `generatePythonStubs` from the same jars `generatePythonArtifactBindings` walked. Nothing in this
 * file is a hand-written stub: `PyiRenderingTest` pins the renderer against models it constructs,
 * and this pins the renderer against Compose, JUnit and `kotlin-stdlib` as they actually are.
 *
 * The claim worth having is the last one. A stub's only job is to describe a surface that exists, and
 * `docs/pyi-generation-design.md` §4.5 states the failure mode precisely -- "a stub that says
 * `Modifier.weight(1.0)` checks is a stub that promises a call the runtime cannot make". So the test
 * is not "the file contains this text", it is **every `def` in the Kotlin-FQN stubs is a key
 * `UpcallTable` resolves, and every key is a `def`**.
