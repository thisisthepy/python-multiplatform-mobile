/**
 * **A Python lambda in a walked, non-`@Composable` declaration** -- `Modifier.clickable(onClick=…)`
 * out of the real `foundation-desktop` jar, and a stdlib declaration that actually *runs* the
 * callable it is handed.
 *
 * ### What this is the end of
 *
 * `a179b747` made a function-typed slot describable and fillable, and both halves are producer-
 * independent -- `ArtifactScanner.functionSlotTypeName` writes the signature, `pythonx._make_function`
 * builds a `FunctionN` out of it. Only composables could use them, because only composables reach
 * their callee through generated **bytecode**: a `CHECKCAST` to `kotlin/jvm/functions/FunctionN`
 * needs no Kotlin name, while generated **source** has to spell the type it casts to, and
 * `resolveKotlinType` correctly refuses to spell a classifier with no class file anywhere.
 * `ArtifactScannerTest` counted the price: 44 of the 46 declined public top-level `Modifier`
 * extensions declined for exactly that.
 *
 * ### Why `measureTimeMillis` is here beside `clickable`
 *
 * Because **no Compose callback runs outside a composition**, and a test that only ever asserts "the
 * call returned a Modifier" cannot tell a wrapper Compose would invoke from one it would not.
 * `clickable` is `composed { }`, `drawBehind` is a node, `semantics` is an element -- every one of
 * them *stores* the lambda for a composition to call later. `kotlin.system.measureTimeMillis(block:
 * () -> Unit)` has the identical slot (`kotlin.Function0()->kotlin.Unit`, same walker, same
 * fragment, same `PythonFunction` wrapper) and invokes it at the moment it is called, so it is what
 * makes "the callback is called" a measurement rather than an inference. Rendering a real click is
 * `:ksp-fixtures:compose`'s job and needs the Compose compiler plugin this module deliberately does
 * not apply.
 *
 * ### Lifetime
 *
 * A Python callable crossing into Kotlin needs a [PythonCallableScope] open -- Compose keeps calling
 * a `content` long after the statement that wrote it dropped Python's last reference, so something on
 * the Kotlin side has to hold one, and the scope is the only candidate that closes at the right time
 * (`PythonCallables`' KDoc has the other three and why they fail). Outside a composition that scope
 * is explicit, which makes it something this test can count: [scope] holds exactly one wrapper per
 * callable that crossed, gives it back on `close`, and answers `0` for every later `close`.
 *
 * `agent-rules` §14 is why the leak and the double release are **separate** assertions with a second
 * scope in between: a root released twice does not fail where it happens, it fails when the slot it
 * freed has since been handed to somebody else.
