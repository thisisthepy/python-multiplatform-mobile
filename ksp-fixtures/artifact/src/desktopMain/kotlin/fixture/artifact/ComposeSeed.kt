/**
 * The declarations `WalkedArtifactComposeModifierTest` needs that the *walker* cannot supply,
 * written as this module's own Kotlin so KSP binds them.
 *
 * ### Why a seed is needed at all
 *
 * A `Modifier` chain has to start somewhere, and the thing it starts from is `Modifier` the
 * *expression* -- `androidx.compose.ui.Modifier.Companion`, an object instance
 * (`docs/kotlin-extensions-in-python.md` §4.2). The artefact walker binds **functions**, so a
 * companion's instance is not something it can hand out; `docs/ecosystem.md` §5b's next step (a
 * `ReflectedClass` and a receiver handle) is where that will come from. Until it does, the empty
 * modifier is one function of our own -- and everything after it is Compose's own code, reached
 * through the walker under Compose's own name.
 *
 * ### Why the checks are functions here rather than assertions in Python
 *
 * The test must prove that a `Modifier` **built in Python** is the real thing, and "the real thing"
 * is a claim only Compose's own types can settle. `toString` on a modifier chain is not it:
 * `PaddingElement` and `SizeElement` are `internal` classes with no `toString` of their own, so the
 * text is `PaddingElement@1a2b3c` and says nothing. What *is* settled is structural equality --
 * `ModifierNodeElement` subclasses implement `equals` by value, and `CombinedModifier` compares
 * both halves -- so comparing the Python-built chain against one this file builds independently
 * proves that Compose's own `padding` ran, with the argument Python supplied, in the order Python
 * chained it.
 *
 * Nothing here builds anything on Python's behalf: [equalsPaddingThenSize] takes the finished chain
 * as its *parameter* and only says whether it matches.

/**
 * The comparisons `WalkedArtifactDefaultOmissionTest` needs, and why each is written the way it is.
 *
 * A default is only *observable* where the value it supplies differs from what a caller could have
 * accidentally passed. Compose's `padding` defaults are all `0.dp`, so "omitted" and "passed zero"
 * produce equal modifiers and would prove nothing. These three do not have that problem:
 *
 * | comparison | the default it reaches | why Python could not have faked it |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | [equalsFillMaxWidth] | `fraction = 1f` | a body that passed `0f` into the omitted slot builds a different `FillElement`, and [equalsFillMaxWidthFraction] is the control that says so |
 * | [equalsWrapContentSize] | `align = Alignment.Center` | `Alignment` crosses as a `TypeTag.OBJECT` handle and **no bound declaration anywhere produces one**, so if the default were not reached there would be nothing to put in the slot at all. This is `docs/pythonx-adapter-design.md` §4.5's argument in a single function |
 * | [equalsVerticalPadding] | `start`, `top` and `end` | the argument that *is* written sits in the middle of the list, which §4.5's arity-prefix candidate cannot express |
